In past years, movable red plastic benches have supplemented the fixed seating. Bike racks abut the building corner at Front Street and Gouverneur Lane. The plaza sliver on South Street enjoys a pleasant view under the F.D.R. Drive and across the East River to Brooklyn. Movable benches and planters have been provided here in the past. Since this plaza was produced under the “as-of-right” plaza provisions of the 1961 Zoning Resolution, none of the provided amenities is required.\n"

The rectangular space does offer amenities not normally found in “as-of-right” plazas, including planters and fixed chairs, tables, and benches. At a recent site visit, the space was under scaffolding and in disarray, so it is difficult to tell what will emerge in the future. Like so many others, the retail-lined arcade has become the last refuge of the banished smoker.\nThe legal documents possessed by the City show elevated plaza space at the northwest corner of the building on West Street. This area, however, is currently occupied by a covered parking structure that is part of the building. The City and the owner will engage in discussions to determine what obligations, if any, the owner has with regard to this area. \n"

            "details": "This popular plaza up several steps from the south side of West 57th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway is a good example of how renovation can improve the nature of a space. The plaza used to be narrow, dark, and depressing, with a worn brick surface and unappealing stuccolike west façade. Tall cylindrical planters clogged the middle, while an extraordinarily long wood bench next to sparse landscaping stretched from front to back. Use of the space was the exception rather than the rule. Now, the space is well-designed, well-appointed, and, not surprisingly, well-used. The clogging planters have been removed. Granite pavers have replaced brick, and low-rise granite walls define the edge. Manicured trees and shrubbery hide the western wall. An extraordinarily long, comfortable, green, wire-mesh bench has taken the place of the wood bench and added more seating at front and back. Granite planter ledges are also available for sitting. Stylish lighting fixtures abound, some attached to the columns of the adjacent, but not required, arcade. The activities of another public space directly south, at Carnegie Mews, are newly visible from the back. In short, this rejuvenated space is a healthy component of a generally reinvigorated West 57th Street. The other plaza space here consists of a slightly elevated terrace wrapping around the northwest corner of West 56th Street and Seventh Avenue, across from Carnegie Hall. The space features more stylish lighting, a double-level red awning, and planters. No seating is provided.\n"

            "details": "Aptly nicknamed Black Rock, this black glass tower, designed by the renowned Finnish architect Eero Saarinen and the firm of Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo, is surrounded by a waterless moat of plaza steps below the public sidewalk. Four mid-block cuts in the perimeter of street-level ledges provide stairwells that descend five, six, seven, or eight steps from their locations on the north side of West 52nd Street, the east side of Sixth Avenue, the south side of West 53rd Street, and the urban plaza at the Deutsche Bank building. The below-street plaza space is designed for circulation in and out of the building, empty but for planters filled with tall trees at the four corners and some movable chairs located from time to time at the northeast corner.\nAt street level, however, the perimeter ledges jump with activity, from salespersons hawking artwork and books to unashamed people-watchers. While the polished stone seating ledge is a hard surface for long perches, its generous depth and graduated heights are perfect for accommodating all types and sizes of people. For example, the ledges along West 53rd Street are lower in height than their West 54th Street counterparts, and thus tend to be used by people who prefer to plant their feet firmly on the ground. The ledges along West 53rd Street also enjoy southern exposure, which may explain their popularity relative to other parts of the perimeter.\nThe adjacent Deutsche Bank urban plaza is worth visiting if only to compare an “as-of-right” plaza produced under the original 1961 Zoning Resolution with an urban plaza produced under the more demanding zoning standards enacted in 1975. Although both plazas provide substantial amounts of ledge seating, the differences become quickly apparent when the user tries out both. Not only is the ledge seating in the urban plaza more comfortable, but that space also furnishes landscaping, artwork, built-in benches, and a unified spatial configuration making for a more usable experience overall.\n"

            "details": "The plaza encircles most of the three street sides of this catercornered tower on the eastern side of Park Avenue between East 33rd and 34th Streets. Triangular portions are situated at north and south corners of the lot. The north side is a raised terrace, paved in brick matching that used for the building, in front of the main entrance where there is a small arcade lined with four square columns. Steps and ledges around the flagpoles and sculpture are used for seating by an unusual combination of office workers and high school students, reflecting the unusual combination of commercial tenants and the Norman Thomas High School occupying the building. The sculpture is a 23-foot-high bronze by Irving Marantz, entitled Obelisk to Peace (1972), set on a polished granite base. The sculpture was Marantz’s last outdoor work before he died and may be compared to another of his pieces, in front of 475 Park Avenue South, two blocks south.\nA mysterious, elevated, table-top space is located in the southern triangle. Behind a locked gate at recent site visits, six steps lead upward to a small triangular platform. No record of City approval for this obstruction or the locked gate has been found. On top is the best seating of the plaza, featuring benches with backs and a small planter with tree. An abrupt drop at the back of the platform suggests that something else was supposed to connect to it, but it is hard to see what that something might have been.\nIn front of the high school entrance on East 33rd Street is more plaza and arcade space. A bench is available, even if the nearby sign prohibits trespassing under penalty of New York State Penal Law. A mirror-image plaza and arcade area on East 34th Street lack the bench and sign.\n"

            "details": "For pure circulation, this indoor through block connection is one of the most pleasant links in the six-block chain of privately owned public spaces forging a mid-block passage from West 51st to 57th Streets between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. Evoking a loosely art deco motif, the design skillfully blends illumination, color, and materials to produce a two-story corridor that is remarkably light, airy, and cheerful for a space without natural light and activities. Recessed ceiling fixtures, uplights hidden behind wall panels, and exposed wall-mounted sidelights bounce their illumination off the slick surfaces of red primarily marble walls and black, white, and gray polished floors. Articulated display windows closer to West 56th Street exhibit theater posters and create the feeling, if not reality, of retail stores along the way. The controlled climate renders the passageway ideal for escaping, albeit briefly, winter and summer extremes of weather. Since the intention of the space was to facilitate movement, seating is neither required nor provided. A small building entrance recess area is located on West 56th Street at the tip of the through block connection. Although the owner received a floor area bonus, it was for the rehabilitation of the City Center Theater rather than for the through block connection.\nThe other spaces in the six-block passageway include the through block gallerias at PaineWebber, the Flatotel, and 1325 Avenue of the Americas, the through block connection at Rihga Royal Hotel, and, to the north, the through block connection at Metropolitan Tower.\n"

            "details": "Even experienced public space observers might be forgiven for assuming that the through-block corridor inside this office tower is a public space. To begin with, similarly configured through-block connections have been encouraged, even required, elsewhere in the city. Another misleading clue is the existence of a through block arcade directly to the north across East 52nd Street at Park Avenue Plaza, connecting to East 53rd Street, which, together with this corridor, would create a two-block mid-block pedestrian pathway. However, the interior corridor here is a private lobby, and the only public space is the urban plaza on the north side of East 51st Street between Park and Madison Avenues.\nBecause other buildings along the north side of East 51st Street hug their lot line, this plaza’s existence is hard to discern from either avenue. Street trees along the public sidewalk thus become an important signal for passersby that this frontage is different. Like the nearby urban plazas at Park Avenue Tower four blocks north on East 55th Street and Tower 49 several blocks southeast on East 48th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, the space is wide and shallow rather than narrow and deep. Like the urban plaza at the Deutsche Bank building several blocks to the west on West 52nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, the space adopts granite as its material of choice for all surfaces. None of this is to say that this urban plaza is especially derivative of others, but simply to suggest that plaza designers rely on a common vocabulary and can end up saying many of the same things.\nThe openness of the design is moderated by a small round planter with four trees and flowers in the middle. Seating is provided in three configurations and locations: a ledge encircling the planter, a linear bench along the western wall, and a ledge surrounding the water sculpture to the east. Entitled Water Trilogy (1986), by sculptor Ron Mehlman, this granite-and-glass abstract work is composed of a tall, narrow trough, set vertically, flanked by slabs and cascading cubes. Water traverses various parts of the trilogy, and the effect is most pronounced when lit at night.\n"

Situated to the east of its host building, it is singularly designed for movement. The southern half is covered with an opaque, vaulted ceiling and largely enclosed by brick wall. The northern half feels more open, covered with a transparent vaulted ceiling that would benefit from a regular schedule of cleaning to take full advantage of the natural light. To the west is an unusual glimpse of back yards attached to nearby apartments.\nAlthough the host building is a hotel, this space has no physical or functional connection to it whatsoever, in apparent conflict with standards articulated in the Zoning Resolution, and no record of approval for such a contradiction has been found. It is instructive to compare this through block connection with the one at Millennium Broadway. What is gained in clarity here – this is unambiguously a public space – may be offset by what is lost in high finish and excitement provided by a shared lobby. The other spaces in the six-block chain include the through block gallerias at PaineWebber, the Flatotel, and 1325 Avenue of the Americas to the south, and the through block connections at CitySpire and Metropolitan Tower to the north.\n"

Instantly setting the mood at its entrance is The Right Light, one of J. Seward Johnson, Jr.’s, life-like bronze sculptures. Standing with head slightly cocked in front of his canvas on easel next to his open case of paint tubes, brushes, and other paraphernalia, an artist peers into the space and paints a copy of part of the five-paneled landscape painting that actually adorns the length of the plaza’s eastern wall.\nThat colossal work, by Lillian Kennedy, depicts a pastoral scene of water, trees, grass, and bridge, perhaps of Central Park or perhaps of a landscape designed by Capability Brown. What is especially successful is how the plaza’s real-life trees, shrubs, overflowing ivy, and brightly colored flowers merge with the wall landscape, playfully blurring the line dividing nature and art. The nicely finished purplish burnt-brick paving and wood surfaces augment the rustic atmosphere. Natural elements continue in the form of a waterfall and pool at the back of the space. Water tumbles through crenellations in a rising brick wall and follows a downward path established by what appears to be fishing lines held in place by fishing tackle sinkers.\nPlentiful seating includes the ledge around the waterfall, a freestanding square planter in the middle of the space, and built-in wood benches with brick backs zigzagging in and out from the art wall. A seating wall laid out at a 45-degree angle from the waterfall occupies a small, sunny protected area at back of the rectangle, behind the residential hotel tower next to a restaurant, where the rest of the city disappears for a moment. In case of rain, the residential plaza furnishes a covered area under a glass canopy close to the entrance, where a wooden bench can easily accommodate four or five persons. A great view of the Chrysler building spire is visible to the north.\n"

            "details": "It is difficult to appreciate the ample size of this plaza because so much of it is under landscaping. A sliver of space parallels the blockfront on the east side of Second Avenue between East 39th and 40th Streets. The ledge bordering the manicured bushes, flowers, and gravel rises along the sidewalk as it makes its way south, allowing the user to find that height best suited to his or her seating preference. Behind the ledge is a semicircular drop-off driveway, although the portion underneath the building itself is not bonused and thus not public.\nThe majority of plaza surface, at north and south sides of the building, is covered by an impenetrable, diverse landscape of ivy, medium-size bushes, and mature full-canopied trees. Birds are heard chirping away in the heart of the space, but the closest that human users are able to get is along the perimeter ledges where, depending on the ledge slant, seating is or is not possible. Because this space fails to incorporate the human user in its landscape, and indeed renders most of the surface physically inaccessible, the question arises how it comports with the 1961 Zoning Resolution. That Resolution defined a plaza as “an open area accessible to the public at all times,” not “more than five feet above nor more than twelve feet below the curb level of the nearest adjoining street . . . unobstructed from its lowest level to the sky.” The only permitted obstructions were “arbors or trellises, awnings or canopies, railings no less than 50 percent open and not exceeding three feet, eight inches in height, flag poles, open terraces or porches, steps, ornamental fountains or statuary, or unenclosed balconies.” Is the word “arbor” sufficiently capacious to incorporate this type of landscaping? Is it enough that a plaza be visually accessible, but physically inaccessible, to humans?\n"

            "details": "Changes in ownership and building use sometimes engender a golden opportunity for revitalizing a previously unsatisfactory privately owned public space. Here, new owner Donald Trump and architect Philip Johnson not only gilded the façade of this Columbus Circle tower to herald its metamorphosis from the Paramount (and old Gulf+Western) office building to the Trump International Hotel and Tower, but also completely transformed the ground-level public space. What was once an afterthought has become a usable plaza surrounding the base.\n\nThe design wisely recognizes that it should not, indeed could not, compete with one of the world’s greatest landscaped places, Central Park, only steps away. Instead, it adopts an understated urban presence that sensibly locates the most usable space along the upper half of the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangular lot, near the southeast corner of Broadway and West 61st Street and away from the park and the automotive chaos of Columbus Circle. Principal entry to this portion is gained up five steps, where a two-headed metal sculpture by David L. Hostetler, entitled The Duo (1997), stands upright, with four stone benches arrayed nearby from which viewers may study the piece. Additional stone benches and wooden chair-benches around tree-filled planters line the eastern back of the space next to the building. A tall tree-filled planter bordering the northern edge provides a desirable sense of enclosure. When the sun suddenly appears around the tower, the space is a dramatic contrast of light and dark.\nLooking south through a crack between the building edge and the space border is a glimpse of Columbus Circle, one of the volumetrically fantastic public spaces in the city. The Circle is in a period of change, with the long-anticipated demolition of the old Coliseum convention center and its replacement with a new 2.1 million-square-foot mixed-use complex promised to begin soon. To obtain a better view, it is necessary to squeeze past a narrowing corridor between the tower and a four-foot plinth, past glass windows that reveal cooks hard at work in the private restaurant kitchen. On the Columbus Circle side is the restaurant’s private terrace area that is legally not part of the public space. In front of it, however, is a planter that avails a sittable ledge, where the full ballet of moving vehicles, rushing pedestrians, pigeons, and other animate and inanimate objects is comfortably observed. Between the building and the Circle is the newly rebuilt subway entrance, decorated above by a pounded silver metal globe sculpture. The Trump Hotel entrance is on the Central Park side, and it is barely possible to stay in public space and continue a circumnavigation of the building to the north.\nAnother change in ownership recently engineered by the eponymous developer, near the southeast corner of Central Park, will, it is hoped, work a similar transformation. For the General Motors Building at Trump International Plaza, located on the east side of Fifth Avenue between East 58th and East 59th Streets, the developer and his designers are raising the sunken portion of the plaza, once utilized by an outdoor café, to street level, and renaming it the Trump International Plaza.\n"

At the northwest corner of Park Avenue and East 79th Street, the plaza follows the semicircular drop-off driveway model, but with a slight twist. In the half-circle area normally reserved for the ornamental fountain are artworks that render the space imageable to the public. The current sculpture, entitled Cat (1984), by Fernando Botero, is a bronze of a well-fed, polar-bear-sized cat with great whiskers. A previous sculpture, by Francisco Zunica, was a bronze of three grand women majestically strutting in different directions. Well-manicured shrubs and trees still surround the sculpture.\nThe space remaining around the driveway is currently filled with small trees and shrubs, but has displayed colorful flowers in the past. On Park Avenue, the plaza space is a small sunken corridor, separated from the sidewalk by a wall adorned with a small fence, heading north into the southern wall of the next building on Park Avenue. On East 80th Street west of Park Avenue is another tiny area of plaza.\n"

A small elevated area steps above the sidewalk is located on East 72nd Street near the garage entry driveway.

The actual space on site is something less, a tiny, dark area shaped like the apse of a cathedral, large enough to accommodate a semicircular concrete bench and small planter. Its sidewalk perimeter is lined with a brick wall, a metal fence, and two gates. Trees growing in the inaccessible portion to the west behind the black metal fence overwhelm the space and block sunlight from reaching its surface. At a recent site visit, the gates were locked. No record of City approval has been found to authorize the physical truncation of the space or the locked gates.\nThe relationship between this space on York Avenue and its host building, located west of York Avenue on East 86th Street, is highly attenuated. It would be no surprise to learn that building residents are unaware that this space belongs to their building. The physical remove of a space from its host building permits disinterest or disavowal without consequence to the building itself. That appears to have occurred in this case. More plaza space is located in front of the building’s East 86th Street frontage west of York Avenue. Well-landscaped planters with spiked ledges flank both sides of the canopied entrance and fully cover the space.\n"

Indeed, the landscaped public open space and pedestrian circulation space here are the only privately owned public spaces in the borough, and the green-tinted glass skyscraper that generated them is strikingly atypical in an area defined by low-rise structures. Once the developers of this tower rejected the conventional wisdom that skyscrapers should stay on the skyscraper side of the East River, it was hardly a stretch that they would Import a “tower in the park” design.\nFormed by the convergence of Jackson Avenue and 44th Drive, the usable space is triangular in shape at the eastern end of the lot. Three stands of birch trees totaling roughly 75 trees struggle to establish a beachhead in this otherwise ill-defined spatial context. Numerous fixed green metal benches serve the lunch crowd as the four-sided antique-style clock keeps time. Part of the space is actually built on 1,537 square feet of City-owned street bed. Across Jackson Avenue to the southeast is a publicly owned public space, with ornamental fountain, polished granite ledges, and greensward, attached to the ornate state Supreme Court building. The design for that square manifestly takes its cue from the courthouse. The interesting question for the landscaped public open space here is whether it has taken its design cue from its host tower and surrounding neighborhood. Additional landscaped public open space and pedestrian circulation space front 44th Drive and 45th Avenue sides of the tower.\n"

Inside, the square plaza is large and uncomplicated. A substantial planter occupies the center, with colorful flowers, plants, and four corner trees, encircled by backed granite benches. Planters with mature overhanging trees and more granite benches line east and west sides of the space. With plentiful sunlight and abundant seating, users are usually able to customize their public space experience for sun or shade during much of the day.\nSituated at the back of Trump Palace, with service entry and trash bin but no true secondary residential entrance, the plaza feels detached from its host tower. Natural opportunities for contact between members of the public and the community of private residents are lost. Thus, it is interesting to compare the qualities of this space with another Trump-developed residential plaza, at Trump Plaza, that by design commingles residents and members of the public to the evident advantage of both.\n"

            "details": "Wrapping around the full blockfront building on the west side of Second Avenue between East 54th and 55th Streets, the Brevard’s public space has experienced a tumultuous life. The space was initially completed in 1974 under the undemanding “as-of-right” plaza standards of the 1961 Zoning Resolution. For years, the building’s restaurant tenant on East 55th Street impermissibly placed tables and chairs in the plaza, triggering a Department of Building’s enforcement action compelling their removal. In 1983, the building owner obtained permission for the open air café with tables, chairs, and waiter service, in return for its agreement to upgrade the plaza. In 1984, the City agreed to “qualify” a portion of the plaza space west of the building on East 55th Street as a “residential plaza,” thereby authorizing the installation of gates and allowing closing at night to combat alleged vandalism and security problems. In return, the owner agreed to provide a still better-designed space with more public amenities. Unfortunately, the troubled past, it would appear, haunts the present. In 1996, the Department of Buildings issued a violation for missing amenities, faulty maintenance, and improper closure. At a recent site visit, some amenities were still missing.\nEvocative of an entrance to a Victorian-era park, the decorative green fence and gate at the mouth of this narrow, deep, rectangular residential plaza should be open from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. or one hour after sunset, whichever is later. According to applicable legal requirements, the concessions stand inside the space must serve refreshments during the same hours that the open air café next to the public sidewalk along East 55th Street is open. Numerous movable white-mesh chairs and tables are arrayed at back near the small brown-brick waterfall and pool, trimmed with iconic sun disk. Metal bars carve flanking wooden benches into individual seating units. Trees, shrubs, and annuals leaven the monotonic color scheme, although they cannot obscure the barbed wire on top of surrounding chain-link fences. Seven steps above the plaza floor to the west is a small patio with more movable tables and chairs, partially covered by a blue canvas canopy.\nOwing to past problems, the open air café and its tables, chairs, and waiter service along East 55th Street are subject to strict, express rules. The café’s perimeter is allowed to be demarcated by a series of low-rise planters, no greater than 18 inches tall, filled with seasonal flowers or shrubs. These planters must be completely removed or placed against the northern wall of the Brevard building during the months when the café is not in operation. No fence, railing, stanchion, or other permanent structure may be placed at either eastern or northern boundaries of the café space, although at a recent site visit, railings were bolted to the ground. Finally, the café must keep its gate at the western end open during all hours that the café itself is open, even if the residential plaza space west of the café is closed. At the southeast corner of East 55th Street and Second\nAvenue is a fixed brick bench and planter for four, with an attached plaque announcing that this is a “public bench.” The plaza space is extra sidewalk in front of retail stores on the west side of Second Avenue and in front of the Brevard lobby on East 54th Street.

Four trees on the public sidewalk in front of the space signal that something different occurs at this point in the pedestrian’s promenade. Elevated several steps above the sidewalk, the rectangular space is open on its western side, providing a perfect court for handball, against the tall blue western wall, but for the interference of six regimentally deployed light stanchions. An inward-facing wooden bench with capacity for a dozen persons is built into the back of an oblong, two-tree planter. A smaller rectangular planter nearby has additional ledge seating. A tiny contained area at the plaza’s eastern side has a four-person bench, and is shielded from the intrusion of an adjacent driveway by a piano-shaped tree-filled planter. For a space as disassociated from its host building as this is, the quality of maintenance and amenity is good.\n"

Surrounded by a metal fence and entered from the covered drop-off driveway next to the hospital that is part of the public space, the south waiting room is a park featuring lots of green benches scattered along loose stone paths amidst tiny mounds of ivy, grass, shrubs, and trees. With its sloping topography, the square park appears to undulate up and down as it climbs the hill. The designers came across an interesting obstruction not explicitly addressed by the zoning laws of public space: a gravesite. Given the nature of the host building’s primary use, a gravesite might not be the most appropriate image for waiting families. On May 3, 1995, the remains of James Henry Roosevelt were removed and reburied in a family crypt at the New York City Marble Cemetery. An austere granite monument now marks the spot.\nThe public open space to the north is a mirror-image park. At a recent site visit, its entrance gate was locked during hours it was required to be open. No record of City approval for such a lockout has been found. The rest of the space includes the wide stairwell, leading from Tenth Avenue to the hospital, its ridged metal handrails engineered to prevent young people from sliding on them. The huge, impressively arched covered driveway is also part of the public open space, and additional wood benches immediately outside the two parks are available for sitting.\n"

            "details": "These two spaces, one at the northwest corner of Lexington Avenue and East 57th Street, the other further west on East 57th Street, offer dramatically distinct environments partially explained by their zoning pedigree. The plaza is grandly theatrical, a large quarter circle left over by the concave front of the office tower base. Situated near the street corner is something that, located in a romantic country landscape, might be called a folly. Here, it is an eye-popping, pseudoclassical pergola com- posed of four sets of two marble-clad columns. The own- ers call it a “tempietto.” Like One Worldwide Plaza, 9 West 57th Street , and 300 East 85th Street, among others, this space becomes etched in collective memory through the presence of an object. Its functionality is simply an added benefit. The rounded interior provides several built-in backless stone seating surfaces, although the sections with backs have sloped their surfaces such that sitting is impossible. At both sides of the tempietto are two square fountains with hedges that extend toward, without ever meeting, the street corner. Seating is also provided on the interior side of the fountains.\nThe open park space to the west is vastly different from the plaza. It is narrow, deep, and intimate, with planter trees along east and west walls that extend their canopies over most of the middle. Colorful flowers abound. At the rear wall is a waterfall topped with a granite globe, while artwork occupies the middle of the wall to the west. Usable amenities include a small food kiosk, movable cafe tables and chairs, and eight wood benches built into the planters that create semiprivate seating areas.\n\nAlthough it is not apparent to the naked eye, the open park space is situated on a zoning lot belonging to the Galleria, a building located west of the space. When the Galleria was developed in 1973, the owner agreed to provide an open park space on this lot, known in the parlance of “block and lot” identifications as Lot 8, after an existing building was demolished. Only when 135 East 57th Street was developed more than a decade later, however, was this obligation satisfied. The Galleria owner had agreed to provide 2,500 square feet of open park space. Because the public space on Lot 8 is 2,008 square feet, an additional 492 square feet of open park space had to be provided. That space is seamlessly blended with the 4,820-square-foot plaza at the corner, creating an undivided hybrid public space there of 5,312 square feet.\nAlthough it was built years after the City adopted new, more demanding zoning rules in 1975 and 1982 for plazas at midtown commercial buildings, this plaza was located in one of the few remaining zoning districts that continued to allow the provision of “as-of-right” plazas governed by the earlier, less demanding rules. Were this space controlled solely by those rules, it could have been another empty horizontal plane devoid of the design features and usable amenities required in post-1975 spaces. Thankfully, the owner and City Planning Commission were able to arrange for a better, more functional space as a component for fulfilling the Galleria’s long-standing obligation.\n"

The strip of residential plaza between the primary space and Broadway has a squeezed, semicircular drop-off driveway.\nThe City and owner currently disagree about the nature and obligations of this space. The owner has told the City that the space is not a residential plaza at all, since, it argues, construction of the building commenced prior to the effective date of the 1977 Zoning Resolution’s residential plaza provisions. Based on available evidence, the City has concluded that the residential plaza standards did, indeed, apply to this space. The owner has agreed to provide the amenities listed below, and the City and owner will be having further discussions to resolve this issue.\n"

            "details": "The scale of this residential plaza, the largest in the city at roughly 27,000 square feet, is staggering. Located in the huge setback area in front of the residential skyscraper and spanning the full blockfront on the west side of First Avenue between East 37th and 38th Streets, the plaza is dominated by an upward-sloping green escarpment, lavishly garnished with flowing ivy, creeping evergreen ground cover, and mature trees. The base of the mound is encased in an undulating brick retaining wall topped with ledges well proportioned for sitting. More than most, this plaza-building marriage readily evokes the modernist, Corbusian “tower in the park” paradigm.\nAt the corners of East 37th and 38th Streets along First Avenue are usable street-level park areas, paved in a decorative brick pattern and lushly landscaped with full-canopied trees, that offer numerous two-sided wooden benches and serpentine bike racks. Sunlight and shade are in abundance here. The plaza benefits greatly from its broad southern and eastern exposure and the complete absence of adjacent skyscrapers immediately to the south. The Midtown Tunnel Access Road guarantees continued access to sunlight unless the tunnel authority were to decide to allow buildings to be constructed in the air rights above its roads.\nAlthough the escarpment is visually impressive, it cleaves the space in two, obstructing direct pedestrian access from First Avenue to the plaza’s interior and beyond. The user is forced to walk around the mound, next to the side streets, before reaching the inner flank, where a large, amphitheater-shaped water feature with cascading waterfall and basin is oriented toward the building. Approached down five steps, the basin exhibits at its center an abstract bronze sculpture, entitled Peirene (1988), by Aristides Demetrios, that resembles an oversized magnet. In front of the water element are plantings of colorful flowers. A permanent space-age canopy hangs over the through-block driveway and stretches toward the water element. Although the driveway between the building and water feature is private, the open area west of it extending to the building wall is part of the required public space.\n"

            "details": "Near Grand Central Terminal on the north side of East 43rd Street about 150 feet east of Lexington Avenue, this rectangular urban plaza offers convenient, functional outdoor space in one of the most congested areas of midtown. Behind open gates recently installed for nighttime closings, the space furnishes generous fixed and movable seating highly utilized at lunchtime. Sittable ledges rim the six black-granite sarcophagus-shaped planters, each with tree and ground cover, projecting from the eastern wall like a horizontal Stonehenge. The planters create opportunities for users to choose between public and private moments, to locate themselves on the tips of, or in between, the projections. Over the years, movable tables and chairs have migrated throughout the space, sometimes resting near the adjacent food service at the front, other times placed at back next to three more fixed benches attached to the north wall.\nThe materials and design are elegant, especially the red-marble walls at lower levels, the pilasters and horizontal bands, and the built-in polished brass-colored litter receptacles that are almost too good for refuse. Across the street is a good view of the Chrysler building, whose decorative eagles threaten to swoop down into the space.\n"

            "details": "The story behind this privately owned public space at the southeast corner of Third Avenue and East 64th Street begins unhappily but ends better. When the host building and plaza were initially constructed, a small structure occupied by a restaurant was erected on a substantial portion of the required plaza along Third Avenue. When the City eventually learned about this encroachment, its Department of City Planning and Department of Buildings, together with its Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA), devised a plan that would allow the restaurant to remain in return for the provision of additional plaza elsewhere on the Third Avenue side and amenities otherwise not required for “as-of-right” plazas. The plan was memorialized in a BSA variance.\nWhere the plaza had previously included a small strip of sunken space several steps below the Third Avenue sidewalk, in front of retail stores, that was of negligible value, the new design would move the stores forward to the Third Avenue lot line, and construct elevated space above the stores otherwise prohibited by the “as-of-right” plaza’s prohibition against space more than five feet above curb level. The variance required extensive landscaping and seating, as well as a television surveillance camera. The owner would be allowed to close the elevated space from midnight until 6:00 a.m. daily.\nThe resulting plaza is certainly superior to the strip plazas churned out by many developers during the 1960s and early 1970s. The elevated plaza may be entered up steps from East 64th Street, east of Third Avenue, or up a narrow stairwell from Third Avenue midway between East 63rd and 64th Streets squeezed between the restaurant and a garage driveway. At a recent site visit, this stairwell entrance was locked, with no record of City approval for this action. Inside the East 64th Street entrance is a small area on top of the stores, featuring three wooden-slat benches with backs, and planters. The main part of the space is several steps below to the east, behind the store and restaurant, almost too secluded from the street given security anxieties, especially in an elevated space. The tall, encircling, white wood planters filled with shrubbery and flowers oddly evoke the feeling of a residential condominium deck near the beach. More wooden-slat benches with and without backs provide seating. The remaining plaza space on East 64th Street is in front of the main entrance to the residential building and has several planters.\n"

            "details": "Although the borough of Manhattan has the lion’s share of New York City’s privately owned public space, it is not surprising that Brooklyn, where comparatively lower land prices and building densities make expansive public space more economically and physically feasible, has the largest single space. Bordered by Jay Street, Willoughby Street, Flatbush Avenue, Tech Place, and Tillary Street, the MetroTech Center development skillfully blends 3.3 acres of Commons and Public Areas with nine existing and proposed commercial and institutional buildings to create an attractive campus-like setting near the heart of downtown Brooklyn.\n\nAlthough this urban renewal project replaced existing buildings, it has not wreaked havoc with the surrounding context. Unlike many large lot developments that prefer self-contained physical environments isolated from their urban neighborhood, MetroTech Center embraces permeability at its perimeter. Myrtle Promenade lives up to its name, a wide east-west spine ideal for promenading as it connects Jay Street and Flatbush Avenue. Fixed green wire-mesh bench seats and lushly planted areas displaying colorful flowers, ivy, and trees mark much of the route, making it as desirable to stop as to circulate. Two north-south corridors traverse Myrtle Promenade as they link Willoughby Street and Tech Place. The interior grid pathway scheme is sufficiently legible that first-time, as well as experienced, users have little trouble navigating to and within the 3.3 acres.\nAt the heart of the MetroTech complex is “The Commons,” a flat park-like space that borrows aspects of European and American landscape design. The numerous rows of symmetrically planted trees growing out of gravel surface recall the tree-filled, gravel-lined areas flanking the grand allées and major gathering points of eighteenth-century European city parks. At the same time, the absence of a formal fountain as focal point and the inclusion of well-groomed grass lawns are more suggestive of an American democratic design approach. The northernmost portion borrows from both, a hard surface rectangle that is both piazza with classical building to the east, or paved surface ready for ice hockey in winter and basketball in summer. Fixed green wire-mesh seat benches conveniently scattered about The Commons provide seating for everyone.\nTo enliven the space, MetroTech Center’s owner and the City’s Public Art Fund asked six artists living and working in Brooklyn to create art that responded to the environment. At a recent site visit, the work in evidence was heavy on urban mythology and symbolism. Near the entrance to Two MetroTech Center, for example, is a floor-level bronze sculpture, by Tom Otterness, of a manhole cover, slightly askew, out of which the proverbial sewer-dwelling alligator with huge eyes munches on a small man whose own head is shaped like a bag of money. Another Otterness sculpture at the edge of The Commons depicts a group of people at the top of a pole holding a globe on top of which is a woman holding her detached head. At the eastern lawn of the Commons is a sculpture pedestal, under which, rather than on top of which, are numerous little bronze men and women in business suits supporting the pedestal above their heads. In addition to the permanent art are temporary installations such as a miniature diving board emerging from the landscaping.\nThe Commons and Public Areas enjoys a healthy interaction among diverse academic, business, and neighborhood interests. Users include students, faculty, and staff from Polytechnic University, tenants of the commercial buildings, and residents and employees outside the immediate MetroTech Center family. Spaces of this size require a visible sense of security, and MetroTech Business Improvement District public safety vehicles visibly patrol the space. Although a sign announces hours of operation as 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., no record of City approval for anything less than 24 hours a day has been located.\n"

            "details": "The design of 885 Third Avenue, known as the Lipstick Building for its curving, telescoping form, permits a break from the rectangular geometry of most public spaces. The pedestrian circulation space consists of everything outside the indoor area of the building. This includes the two-story arcade, as well as all open space, on the east side of Third Avenue, the north side of East 53rd Street, and the south side of East 54th Street. Framed by polished, marble-clad columns, the arcade offers a 300-degree promenade that is noticeably curvaceous. Indeed, at its westernmost point, it virtually touches the eastern border of the Third Avenue public sidewalk. At a recent site visit, the arcade space on East 54th Street was partly obstructed by café tables and chairs. No record of City approval for the tables and chairs has been found.\nLike the public space at 599 Lexington Avenue several blocks to the southeast, the space here was obtained as part of the special permit authorizing a floor area bonus in return for a subway improvement. Constructed of rough-hewn granite, the new stairwell at the northeast corner of Lexington Avenue and East 53rd Street to the subway also provides a planter and landscaping. Further east on East 53 rd Street is a grove of 12 trees and a bicycle rack. The East 54th Street side has another seven trees.\n"

The shallow depth situates users practically on the public sidewalk, next to the street. The neighboring Queensboro Bridge and its nonstop traffic are also hard to ignore. Nonetheless, to its credit, the plaza invokes the attitude and language, if not the reality, of a small urban park. Almost everything is colored green, from the wooden lattice adorning the western wall to the old-fashioned park benches, lamps, and drinking fountain, to the four decorated planters filled with flowers and birch and evergreen trees. A sloping, stone bench is actually a sculpture, entitled Bench (1989), by Jean Jacques Perron and Carole Bory. Building residents enter their lobby under a canopy near the eastern end, but there is no sense of strong separation between public and private users.\n"

            "details": "Although the building has chosen, unsurprisingly, to use Wall Street for its address and primary entrance, its 360-degree, full-perimeter arcade provides easy, protected passage to the highly usable through-block urban plaza, connecting Water and Pearl Streets, at its rear. The urban plaza is a large, rectangular space, fashioned primarily of red brick, that slowly negotiates the grade change from Water Street up to Pearl Street. With their relative maturity, generous canopy, and open understory, the numerous trees create one of the most naturalistic ambiances of the downtown public spaces. The area nearest Water Street has four planters, made of brick bases and granite slab ledge tops, each with a single tree and a ground cover of colorful annuals. The combination of brick and granite is an adept design choice, making it appear that the planter emerges holistically from the sweeping brick surface of the plaza while providing users with the smoother granite ledge for sitting. Unfortunately, that sittable ledge is marred by narrow, bisecting metal strips designed to prevent users from lying down. It also means that any user must look carefully before sitting lest he or she land on one of the metal strips.\nWater walls and pools line the southwest edge of the urban plaza. Although they seem too detached from the rest of the space, they have the consequent virtue of creating something of a refuge for those seeking privacy. The detachment and subsequent privacy are enhanced by a substantial and curious brick structure, looking like one side of a colonnade, that tracks the western side of the space from Water to Pearl Street and provides visual definition to the access ramp for the physically disabled.\nThe remaining two-thirds of plaza is largely covered by a planted area filled with birch trees, whose tops are sprinkled from time to time with sunlight. The planted area is surrounded on all sides by the two-toned sittable ledges, including a semicircular cutout in the middle supplying three levels of ledges on which to sit and stare back at Water Street. When provided, the 16 movable chairs leaven the locational rigidity of ledges and allow users to customize their social arrangements.\nAs for the arcade, it is one of several that more or less fully encircle the bases of their host towers. The arcades at Goldman Sachs and 17 State Street are other examples. Non-Bonused Public Open Space is indivisibly provided as part of the urban plaza and arcade.\n"

            "details": "“I think it’s beautiful. I’m really overwhelmed . . . I didn’t expect this,” says one middle-aged woman visiting this covered pedestrian space and its four-story atrium at the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and East 47th Street for the first time. That is a common reaction among most first-time users who stumble upon it and wonder why they had not known of it before.\n\nThe space is a smaller, less glitzy rendition of Trump Tower’s covered pedestrian space 10 blocks north, with similar materials, color palette, and criss-crossing escalators. But that is where the similarity ends. While Trump Tower is a triumph of marketing, making it one of the “must see” places, along with the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, on a typical tourist itinerary, 575 Fifth has yet to be discovered, even by resident New Yorkers who would greatly value its quiet demeanor and uncrowded atmosphere.\nThe modest entrances off the east side of Fifth Avenue or East 47th Street, through arcade spaces, hardly foreshadow the scene inside. Down a short corridor from the Fifth Avenue entrance, one unexpectedly encounters the part post-modern, part art deco, part streamlined moderne, four-level atrium. The street-level corridors surrounding the atrium core, and the full concourse level below constitute the required square footage of the covered pedestrian space. The public area includes the second floor corridors. Polished red-and-white-swirled marble floors, sienna-hued granite walls, towering lacquered columns, and brass trim aim to communicate luxury. Reflections of light shimmer vibrantly on the high sheen surfaces, and the floor is so slick that placards warn users of slippery conditions when shoes are wet from rain or snow. The atrium is crowned by a 1,600-square-foot stained glass ceiling, by artist Hank Prussing, composed of geometric patterns rendered in vivid blues, purples, yellows, and browns. An elaborate multi-level conveyance system connects level to level. Parallel escalators arrayed east-west link the Fifth Avenue side of the first floor to the second floor. Escalators at the eastern side of the first floor track the same route but descend to the concourse level. Escalators tying second and third floors pass each other in opposite directions along a north-south alignment. A tube-shaped-glass-and-brass-trimmed elevator reminiscent of John Portman-influenced hotel atria rises at the southeast corner, and people enter it as much for the ride as for purposeful transportation. Taken together, these transport devices visually summon forth a tame version of Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis” and its pulsating systems of movement.\nThe concourse level harbors a number of usable amenities. A central court is framed by elegant marble planters filled with colorful flowers and plants. Metal benches are nestled against the inside wall of the planters, between six four-story lacquered columns. Pleasant-sounding small fountains sparkling with uplights flank the escalators. Surrounding the court is an outer corridor meant to be fronted by retail stores and a restaurant to the north. The tables and chairs here appear to be used by the adjacent restaurant, but should be available to members of the public without obligation to purchase anything. Restrooms are located near the southeast corner of the outer corridor, but were locked at a recent site visit. Another public restroom is available off the southeast corner of the public area on the second floor.\nWith all the accoutrements, the retail promise of the space has yet to be realized. According to marketing literature distributed by the building around the time it opened 15 years ago, “This 55,000 square foot retail phenomenon will be surrounded in all directions by some of the most prestigious stores to be found anywhere.” The plan was for fashion apparel stores to occupy the second and third floors, for small boutiques carrying fashion accessories to be on the first floor, and for everything from a wine bar to a gourmet food shop to stores selling stationery, luggage, and home furnishings to line the concourse floor. Although some national clothing retailers have rented space here, the atrium has not yet achieved the goal set forth in its literature, and storefronts, especially at upper and concourse floors, have suffered from vacancies.\nWhy has this atrium had a mixed record as a retail space? Retail experts might spotlight the inherent difficulties associated with vertical retailing, the store mix, the design layout, changing retail trends, and the street location. Urban planners and designers might question the validity of an internalized, vertical specialty retail mall on one of the world’s greatest shopping streets. Adopted in 1971, the Special Fifth Avenue District zoning encouraged such covered pedestrian spaces with floor area bonuses, in the belief that the Fifth Avenue sidewalks were becoming too crowded for their own good and that more retail opportunities along the street would be helpful. It was not necessarily endorsing or vouchsafing a market concept, however. In the end, the weakness of retail activity might simply suggest that people prefer to shop at street level, from sidewalks, especially when that street is Fifth Avenue.\nHow, then, should the success of Trump Tower, itself a vertical mall, be understood? Trump was earlier, bigger, flashier, blessed with a few marquee high-end retailers, and situated at a higher traffic location. Its success may be measured in tourist crowds, although such crowds do not always translate into hard retail dollars. Indeed, much of Trump Tower’s retail is of greater interest to tourists than to New Yorkers. For the public space user, however, the relative underuse of 575 Fifth Avenue augments its allure. Huge retail success here might, ironically, detract from one of the space’s greatest assets.\n"

            "details": "This urban plaza at the northeast corner of Park Avenue and East 40th Street is divided into formal and functional zones. The formal exists in the void created by the building’s architecture, which has sliced off the southwest corner of the office tower. Elevated slightly above the public sidewalk, the capacious, granite-paved triangle embraces the horizontal plane and provides a visual foreground setting off the impressive columns of the glass-covered arcade and multistory lobby. The hollow quality of the pavers may be attributable to the fact that a parking garage is located below. Steps and a planter ledge at the northwest portion provide seating opportunities along Park Avenue.\nA volcano-shaped fountain hides the functional zone, a fingerlike extension off the formal space along East 40th Street. This narrow multilevel rectangular area features a startling array of granite surfaces that might initially be mistaken for steps; in fact, these are all seating surfaces, which include a long, undulating, granite ledge, steplike ledges, and ledges around six planters filled with lush trees and shrubs bordering the sidewalk edge. Oriented as they are toward the street, the ledges resemble bleacher seats, although the view to the street below is largely blocked by the trees. Two semiprivate nooks may be found at the far eastern end, including a circular alcove nine steps above the public sidewalk, and a triangular area in front of a café 10 steps above and east of the circular space. A nighttime visit to this part of the urban plaza reveals the 240 linear feet of fluorescent lighting found within the silver handrails, as well as the uplight in the volcano fountain.\nAlthough the sidewalk widening is located on East 41st Street, the public sidewalks on East 40th and Park Avenue themselves receive special treatment. Along East 40th Street, the trees on the sidewalk and in the space collaborate to form a canopy that refreshes the passing pedestrian. Bronze plaques featuring images of famous buildings are spaced along the sidewalk on East 40th Street and Park Avenue.\n"

It comes as no surprise that the sunny, southern space is the consistent winner in terms of public use. At lunchtime, users clamor to find available slots on its serpentine, polished granite planter benches hugging east and west walls. At other times during the day, the space becomes an outdoor smoking room. By contrast, the benches on East 49th Street remain relatively uninhabited much of the time. Given the intense competition for seating, it is almost regrettable that there could not be more seating on the sunny side, especially within the expanse of vacant plaza in the middle.\nTower 49 has three other categories of public space. Its western lobby corridor doubles as a public access passageway that, joined with Saks Tower to the north, connects East 48th to East 50th Streets and fashions one of six mid-block, privately owned public space networks in the city. The arcade space borders both sides of the tower behind tall, shiny silver, cylindrical columns. A strip of space parallel to the public sidewalk on East 49th Street is legally classified as sidewalk widening, although it would be hard to distinguish it on site from the urban plaza.\n"

            "details": "Like many of its neighboring office towers, the Goldman Sachs building was developed in, around, and over a historically significant part of the city. The tower is adjacent to two historic districts designated by the City’s Landmarks Preservation Commission. East is the Stone Street Historic District, designated in recognition of its 17th- and 18th-century Dutch colonial street pattern of New Amsterdam and treasure trove of stylistically representative 19th- and early 20th-century small-scale merchant and commercial buildings erected after a devastating fire in December 1835. South across Pearl Street is the Fraunces Tavern Block Historic District and its early 19th-century, low-rise structures that survived the fire.\n\nWhen landmark buildings are threatened by new development, public policy solutions have ranged from requiring the complete preservation of the building to grafting building elements, most notably the historic façade, onto the new structure. Solutions involving less-than-full historic preservation inevitably raise controversy. To some, such solutions represent faux historic preservation and are rejected out-of-hand. To others, such solutions reflect the pragmatic outcome of complex balances that are necessarily struck between preservation interests and other economic and social interests in the high-stakes cauldron of urban development politics and the physical evolution of cities. With its Villard Houses courtyard, the New York Palace Hotel at 457 Madison Avenue is a good example of this debate.\nHere, the historic issues principally involved street-and below-street level conditions rather than existing buildings, and the public spaces became a major avenue for addressing them. To begin with, the new building was built directly on a portion of Stone Street, whose historic lineage dates back to the 17th-century period of Dutch settlement. To enable the tower’s construction, the City demapped and closed Stone Street between Broad Street and Coenties Alley, but required that the alignment of the new building’s lobby follow the Stone Street alignment and be a publicly accessible lobby through which the public could walk as if on Stone Street, from Broad Street to Coenties Alley, after which the “real” Stone Street continues to the east. A 1980 press release announcing the building’s development described the lobby path as “the Spirit of Stone Street.”\nOwing to security concerns expressed by Goldman Sachs in the summer of 1999, the Department of City Planning agreed to the owner’s installation of turnstiles inside the building at both ends of the lobby corridor. Members of the public wishing to enter and pass through the lobby must now approach the security desk, where an attendant will immediately activate the turnstile to permit public passage. In addition, the building must post three signs: one at each entrance to the building stating that the public is welcome to follow the route of Stone Street; and a third installed by Heritage Trails New York in the adjacent urban plaza describing the historic significance and configuration of Stone Street.\nThe public spaces here adopt another convention for recognizing the past: special paving patterns, plaques, and exhibits that depict and explain the historic significance of the site. For example, the paving pattern of the sidewalk widening along Broad Street beckons the pedestrian to the building entrance, where a bronze-colored map derived from a 1660 drawing is set into the sidewalk surface. Along with brown paving stones, the map shows the original alignment of Stone Street (then called Hoog Straat) leading directly through the building’s lobby, as well as the location of other Dutch city landmarks, including Fort Amsterdam, the Bowling Green, and Marketfield Street.\nOther plaques and exhibits in and out of the urban plaza and arcade next to Pearl Street describe how one of the city’s largest-ever archaeological excavations was conducted on-site with 30 archaeologists from 1979 to 1980, how it uncovered wells, privies, and cisterns from the backyards of early Dutch houses, and how it located the foundation of a 17th-century Dutch tavern that became New York’s first city hall. Embedded, transparent horizontal display covers reveal some of the archaeological material unearthed during this project, including an 18th-century cistern complete with household refuse and the tavern’s foundation walls. Gray paving stones outline the approximate location of the rest of the tavern’s walls, while cream-colored paving indicates the ground covered by the structure.\nThe linear, through-block urban plaza east of the building provides a functional space for relaxing and eating food purchased from neighboring cafés and stores on adjacent Coenties Alley. Two rows of 20 planters with trees march up and down the space. A long granite ledge near the trees and three wooden benches at the Pearl Street tip furnish seating. The space parallel to Pearl Street going to Broad Street looks public and provides seating, even if legally it is not required to be public.\nFinally, the building incorporates a rare arcade typology, one that circumnavigates the entire base. Rimmed by rough granite columns, this spacious passageway is lit by hanging white and gold globes that conceptually reinforce the circumnavigation theme while subtly referencing the new global economy promoted by financial firms such as Goldman Sachs. More sidewalk widening borders South William Street.\n"

            "details": "The usable part of this L-shaped special permit plaza is located between Water and Front Streets, at the southwest side of the building, in the street bed of what used to be part of Pine Street until it was demapped by the City in 1970. This rectangular space appears to be bordered on two sides by office buildings, although a portion of it to the southwest actually belongs to the plaza at 100 Wall Street. A wall of rough-hewn brick, softened by water pouring down its slanted face, visually and audibly blocks much of Front Street, making this space well suited for lunch and other outdoor uses. In front of the waterfall, on a minutely raised surface, are a round planter with ledge seating, three black benches, five trees, and 24 movable white wire mesh chairs lashed together in fours. The lashing is to assure that anyone walking off with a movable chair, always a concern with public spaces, will have to transport four rather than one, a far more daunting carry. Pretend owls perched on the second and third floors of 88 Pine Street stand guard against pigeons, mice, and other city creatures.\n\nNear the Water Street side of the special permit plaza is a two-piece abstract sculpture, by Taiwanese artist Yu Yu Yang, consisting of a large shiny stainless steel disk standing upright next to a 16-foot-tall steel rectangle with a circular hole in it, suggesting that the disk has been cut from the rectangle. This circle in the square creates an intriguing visual and philosophical perspective for the viewer who repeatedly regresses in the reflection of the disk. The space moves from the artistic to the touristic with a plexiglass-covered memorial to the “Queen Elizabeth I,” the British ocean liner that caught fire and sank on January 9, 1972, in Hong Kong, where it was to serve as a floating university. Two bronze initials taken from the ship’s bow, a Q and an E, are displayed, as are a letter from Queen Elizabeth’s private secretary lamenting the disaster and a telegram from Kurt Waldheim. The shrine’s placement here is explained by the fact that the owner of 88 Pine Street also owned the Queen Elizabeth I.\nThe remainder of the plaza, a strip with trees, continues along the Water Street frontage to Maiden Lane. Both the address and name of the building, 88 Pine Street and Wall Street Plaza, may cause confusion in that the building is not on Pine nor on Wall Streets. But Pine Street once did border this location and Wall Street is, well, a good address.\nThe enclosed public space at 180 Maiden Lane is across Front Street and worth a visit.\n"

            "details": "Obscured behind 30 Lincoln Plaza is a delightful, neighborhood landscaped plaza. Although access is available from the south side of West 63rd Street east of Broadway, the greatest drama is presented by entering from the east side of Broadway between West 62nd and 63rd Streets. After traversing the store-lined Broadway full blockfront mandatory arcade and continuing east between rows of columns in the plain covered plaza, the visitor emerges into a surprisingly capacious open area. A ground-level corridor surrounds a brick terrace, three steps up, upon which are scattered white movable chairs, three-person fixed wooden benches, and lots of people from the neighborhood.\nA mysterious landscape arises mound-like out of a brick fortification further east. A narrow strip of lush lawn, connected to a larger patch to the north, defines the foreground. A small waterfall tumbles down part of the fortification into a reflecting pool in the midground. The background is composed of a lush forest of tall trees and understory plants that block views of surrounding structures while framing the midground and foreground. Brightly colored flowers add punctuation marks. This landscaped scene is one of the more felicitous to be found in the City’s collection of privately owned public spaces.\nThe physical inaccessibility of the majority of the landscaped plaza raises questions. The user wonders, rather than wanders, about the forest beyond, with public access limited to the surrounding brick terrace and the patch of lawn closer to West 63 rd Street. At the same time, the landscaping performs the minor miracle of making this space feel parklike, as if a patch of Central Park had jumped over Central Park West. Visually accessible space that engages the psyche can in some cases by as useful as physically accessible, usable space. In addition to the mandatory arcade that joins with One Lincoln Plaza to the north for a two-block run of blockfront arcades, there is special permit arcade space on West 62nd Street and at the southern end of the landscaped plaza.\n"

            "details": "By design, this residential plaza declines to distinguish between public and private users. Located on the north side of East 61st Street slightly west of Third Avenue, the deep, rectangular space leads at a slight incline to the lobby entrance. There is no physically separate entry corridor within or next to the space, under canopy or set off by obstructions, dedicated to residents, nor is there a front door located away from the public space. Members of the public and residents of the building share the space equally, even as they pursue distinct ends.\nThat is not to say that this condition of integration is uniformly applauded. One Trump Plaza resident in his forties tersely complains, “I live here, so I don’t like it. Anybody can come.” Revealing a more accommodating attitude, a younger resident comments, “I knew it was a public space. I read the offering plan, and there’s a little plaque that gives the details. I think it’s very attractive. . . . As long as people don’t litter, and they appreciate it and enjoy it without destroying it, that’s what it’s there for. I think it enhances the building. It also enhances the city.” The doorman succinctly sums up: “The public comes everyday. The residents use it.”\n\nAs with many public spaces on side streets, the pedestrian on the avenue cannot see it even though it is only steps away. One idea worthy of future consideration is to require owners of avenue frontage buildings with side street spaces to display a public space plaque on the avenue side with directions to the space. The Trump Plaza plaque is located at the southeast edge of the space, behind fast-growing landscaping that has in the past threatened to obscure the sign. In the late 1980s, there was a neighborhood epidemic of plaque thefts, and this one was literally ripped off the wall by thieves presumably interested in its brass content. More recent plaques have been fabricated from less valued materials.\nBordering the west side of the space is a tall, wide water wall composed of vertically mounted stone strips carved with horizontal ridges that momentarily grip the water as it makes its downward fall into the pool. The wall resembles a war memorial awaiting the inscription of names of fallen soldiers. A built-in polished granite bench stretches along the water wall and pool. The water element is sufficiently well-regulated that users may sit with the assurance that they will not be drenched by spray. The same cannot be said for the drinking fountain, with its occasionally startling spurts, but at least it works, a condition too often absent at other residential plazas.\nOn the eastern side of the space is another built-in granite bench nestled into a large planter filled with a variety of trees and bushes. Users play hide-and-seek with the sun. In late morning, sunlight pours over the western side; parents and caregivers with babies appear to prefer the shady side, while messengers and joggers clearly like the sun. At the rear of the plaza are two more benches.\nWest of the lobby, where there is a small, naturalistic, outdoor garden, issues of public versus private become more sensitive. The doorman matter-of-factly instructs that “the public space ends here; the garden isn’t public.” Since the garden is part of the residential plaza, he is technically wrong. Since the garden is classified as “visual residual space,” however, he is, for practical purposes, right. Unlike primary and usable residual subcategories of residential plazas, this subcategory may exclude physical public access, rendering it a “look, but don’t touch” geography. Additional visual residual space is located at the back of Trump Plaza on East 62nd Street.\n"

Entered from the southeast corner of First Avenue and East 70th Street up several curving steps, or further east from East 70th Street up more steps or a ramp, the space creates a pleasant interior with abundant ledge seating and two benches adjacent to the grade-level garden at the eastern edge, usable so long as passersby are made aware that the interior, indeed, exists. Usable residual space lines the First Avenue commercial frontage, providing several benches for seating.\nThis residential plaza offers a particularly instructive lesson on the benefits wrought by 1977 reforms to the Zoning Resolution. In the pre-1977 era of “as-of-right” plazas constructed at the bases of residential towers, it is easy to imagine that this space would have been a semicircular drop-off driveway and porte cochere in front of the lobby entrance. Now, this space satisfies a meaningful definition of public use based on functional and visual quality. Whatever specific critique one might level at the design of this or other residential plazas, it is worth visualizing a driveway or empty strip to appreciate the improvements rendered by the 1977 reforms.\n"

            "details": "Bounded by Front Street, Maiden Lane, South Street, and Pine Street, 180 Maiden Lane provides a well-appointed enclosed public space that was a mandatory lot improvement for Parcel 20Q of the 1973 Special Manhattan Landing Development District, one of the City’s special purpose zoning districts, repealed in 1998. The idea behind such districts is that a more fine-tuned, site-specific planning and zoning approach is needed in certain geographic areas in the city, particularly with regard to pedestrian amenities and circulation systems. For this district, the City mapped an intricate network of improvements, never fully realized, within a narrow strip along the East River from the southern tip of Manhattan north to the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges.\n\nThis enclosed public space is the best fully indoor privately owned public space in downtown Manhattan. Most likely entered from the intersection of Front Street and Maiden Lane, the space lays out as a multistory, multifunctional atrium bathed in reflected gold tones. The tubular support frame glistens against the enveloping glass walls, and the brasslike cladding on interior columns is actually painted wood, an architectural trompe l’oeil. Tall trees illustrate the substantial scale and, along with the several planters, foster a calm, natural ambiance. The bamboo trees at 590 Madison Avenue’s covered pedestrian space in midtown Manhattan are brought to mind. Escalators and stairs rise from the middle of the space to the private lobby above.\nOf equal importance to the space’s felicitous appearance is its functionality. On the Maiden Lane and Pine Street sides are seating areas replete with black wire movable chairs and tables, as well as polished stone planter ledges. The Pine Street side is also well programmed, with a portable platform set up for regularly scheduled performances and special events, a video wall with multiple television monitors, a food kiosk, and public restrooms. Underneath the private lobby is an art gallery exhibition area.\nFor a space that does not lack for things to see and do, its hours of operation, weekdays from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm, are sadly constrained. At night, the potential user feels like the classic outsider, nose pressed against glass, enviously watching the glistening lights and private happenings that take place from time to time. But it must be emphasized that the hours of operation are legally approved and even make sense for a downtown that tends to clear out once the workday is done. Still, with substantial visitation at nearby South Street Seaport, and with new efforts to increase the number of downtown residents underway, this space could be enjoyed during evening hours in ways that may not have been anticipated when the hours were originally established.\nThe outdoor public space is a strong complement to the indoor space during summer months. The area along Front Street has six backless polished stone benches, angularly shaped and alternating with two rows of trees. The waterfall at the 88 Pine Street special permit plaza to the southwest is less than a stone’s throw away, across Front Street.\n"

            "details": "When completed in 1975, the Citicorp building (as it was then named) garnered initial attention for its silvery aluminum-clad tower, poised for takeoff on four 10-story stilts and topped with a rakish slanted roof. But its interior design quickly gained an independent reputation among members of the public and public space specialists. Although the building exhibited four different kinds of privately owned public space — a plaza, open air concourse, through block arcade, and covered pedestrian space — it was the covered pedestrian space and its seven-story atrium that became the featured attraction.\nThe development occupies almost the entire block bounded by Lexington and Third Avenues, and East 53rd and 54th Streets, excluding a small area at the corner of East 53rd Street and Third Avenue. In its middle is the 7,247-square-foot covered pedestrian space, on the building’s concourse level below the street. There are six access points from the surrounding streets, including two entrances to the through block arcade and down the escalator from either East 53rd or 54th Streets between Third and Lexington Avenues, another entrance on East 53rd Street closer to Lexington Avenue, an entrance from the plaza down steps into and through the open air concourse from the northeast corner of East 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue, an entrance from the Lexington Avenue plaza closer to East 54th Street through exterior and interior corridors and down an escalator, and an entrance down steps from the southwest corner of East 54th Street and Third Avenue and through a private restaurant. This last path is confusing, even treacherous, as users must navigate past waiters, patrons, and crowded tables along a trail that is not always expressly delineated. Still, compared with most indoor spaces containing below-ground levels, this one is unusually accessible from the street, and such permeability is an important element in enticing pedestrians to visit otherwise off-the-path, below-ground interiors.\nOnce there, the full scope of the cavernous atrium is revealed, rising seven stories and cresting in three glass A-frame skylights. The covered pedestrian space level is ringed by circulation corridors and storefronts at concourse and street levels, while the upper levels consist of glass picture windows interspersed with bands of polished aluminum. Public space users from below watch the office tenants above as much or more than the office occupants peer down.\nThe space features a cornucopia of usable amenities. Numerous movable round and square tables and chairs are packed onto the polished granite floor. The kiosk and surrounding stores furnish food for a crowd that, especially at lunchtime, can be so large that people sometimes must wait for tables and chairs. Thankfully, even at noon when crowds begin to gather, the space is never too noisy or chaotic. Its size absorbs sound, while its muted lighting scheme and natural sunlight intermittently filtering through the skylight calm the visual scene. The recent addition of muzak will hopefully be short-lived. The requirement that there be one use or sales area for every 25 feet of frontage on the East 53rd Street side of the space is meant to encourage a diversity of casual restaurants and takeout facilities that, in the past, has worked so well here. The women’s restroom is located underneath the East 54th Street through block arcade entry; the men’s under the East 53rd Street entry.\nSince its opening 25 years ago, this covered pedestrian space has displayed a mix of identities molded by private and public aspirations. For a time, it sought status as a shopping mall, advertising itself through snazzy marketing plaques as the “Market in the Atrium,” where “The Sky’s the Limit. Boogie Woogie. Rock ‘n Roll. And All that Jazz. Little Bit of Broadway. And Lots of Razzmatazz. It’s Magical. A Festival. A Carnival. Day and Night. A Pure Delight. Come on in the Atrium. For Fun. For Free. The Place to Be.” Market realities and strategic repositioning eventually altered this approach, replacing it with more modest retail goals.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the space was heavily used on weekends by immigrants from Hungary, Czechoslovakia (when it still was Czechoslovakia), and other Eastern European countries. They would come in weekly from Forest Hills and other city neighborhoods for a rendezvous and snack with friends. That Citicorp, the quintessential representative of capitalism, should provide space for a reconstituted community of Iron Curtain country refugees, was an amusement commented upon by several of the regulars. The space to this day serves as venue for special occasions. One group of cousins arranges a yearly get-together, as their spokesperson describes, “We come from Brooklyn. This is a great meeting place. We have the restaurants here, and we have a favorite . . . and then [we] come back here and have our dessert and coffee and talk a little longer, and we show pictures of our children, wedding pictures, children, and whatever. I like seeing people of all ages too. I like to study them. There are all kinds that make up the world, and you can see some that are very lonely, others studying.” The space appears to be best understood as a hybrid, neither fully dedicated to retail, like Trump Tower, nor fully devoid of retail, like 590 Madison Avenue. It gains much of its identity from its diverse, changing set of users, like neighborhoods throughout the city.\nThe covered pedestrian space is one of two indoor spaces here. Entered down several steps from the public sidewalk, the through block arcade bisects the building, east and one level above the covered pedestrian space floor, connecting East 53rd and 54th Streets. The level change from the sidewalk tends to hide the through block arcade from sidewalk pedestrians, discouraging pedestrians from using a shortcut that requires marching down and up steps. The two outdoor spaces are best understood from a standing start at the northeast corner of Lexington Avenue and East 53rd Street. At street level is the plaza, a small sliver of extra sidewalk along the avenue that features a well-utilized seating ledge and three flagpoles. It would be interesting for flagpoles, a common obstruction in public spaces, to fly specially designed public space flags along with more traditional ones. The plaza sliver closest to East 54th Street fronts the geometrically challenging St. Peter’s Church, known for its jazz vespers, organ recitals, and Louise Nevelson sculptures. A window on East 54th Street allows the pedestrian to watch the congregation.\nLike 55 Water Street with its elevated plaza, Citigroup Center is one of a small group of catalyst buildings whose proposed development literally inspired the legal introduction of a new category of bonused public space, the open air concourse, to the Zoning Resolution. The two-level sunken open air concourse is entered down 24 steps from the corner of Lexington Avenue and East 53rd Street. Water cascades along the face of a primitive, monolithic structure next to the steps, reaching its aural crescendo at the bottom. Softened by several trees growing out of the pavement, the upper level of the open air concourse is dedicated to circulation into the building interior and the covered pedestrian space to the east and into the subway station to the southeast. A lower level, north and down another eight steps, supplies metal tables and seats. The views from here are stimulating. Above and east is the underbelly of the cantilevered tower, whose awesome mass and engineering convey the feeling one might have at the base of a rocket. Another view of the church interior is available to the north.\n"

            "details": "Since the building once known as the IBM building was formally dedicated on October 4, 1983, its glass-enclosed covered pedestrian space has garnered near universal recognition as New York City’s peerless privately owned public space, a tree-filled conservatory and public living room rolled into one. Like many storied urban places, it has generated its share of amusing anecdotes and intriguing characters. In the late 1980s, after trying out a number of midtown indoor public spaces as rent-free offices for their budding dress company, two enterprising New Yorkers selected the IBM space. And for years, a red-sweatered woman devotedly occupied a small spot and assiduously typed away on her manual typewriter. Along with the countless others who have enjoyed eating, conversing, reading, and resting here, the presence of these users has epitomized the ideal of an inclusive, non-commercial, privately owned public space in the heart of the city.\n\nPerhaps it is this deeply felt affection, indeed sense of public ownership, that explains why a proposal put forward several years ago by the building’s new owner to remove some of the emblematic 45-foot-high bamboo tree stands and install in their stead a sculpture exhibition area with vaguely private, commercial overtones — art for trees — was greeted with some dismay. When the Minskoff ownership group purchased the IBM building in 1994 and applied to the City Planning Commission one year later for permission to modify the space, alarm bells sounded. Here was someone about to tamper with sacrosanct public space, something that could be tolerated only if it were conclusively demonstrated that the changes would improve existing conditions.\nThe owner originally proposed to reduce from 11 to 5 the number of bamboo tree stands and remove the low dish planters to make physical and visual way for the indoor sculpture garden displaying large-scale artworks by major artists of the twentieth century, rotated regularly under the direction of the Pace Wildenstein Gallery. The owner also proposed to increase the amount of seating (albeit with benches substituting for some of the movable chairs), to decrease the number of movable tables, and to relocate the food kiosk from southwest to southeast corners, making it more visible from Madison Avenue. After hearing arguments for and against the changes, and after the owner agreed to retain 8 of 11 bamboo stands, install additional movable chairs without benches, and keep the tables, the City Planning Commission gave its approval.\nPublic response has generally tracked originally expressed opinions for and against the modification. Although some observers are disappointed with the results, others are gratified that the space has retained some of its most salient qualities and introduced a new one. The 65-foot-high triangular, glass-covered atrium remains an aesthetically dramatic, yet peaceful room. Supported by a structure of criss-crossing white metal tubing, the serrated glass roof and glass walls framing East 56th Street and part of Madison Avenue permit streams of sunlight to splash the bamboo trees and wash the white granite floor. At times, the light is so intense that it gives the space a faded look, especially during the summer months, although the looming host tower to the northeast and the Sony tower south across the street anchor the user in the very real, very dense midtown Manhattan.\nWhile Wordsworth’s “brotherhood of venerable trees” has been diminished, and the planters once filled with brightly colored azaleas, lilies, and tulips that changed with the seasons are sadly absent, sculptures by such artists as Henry Moore, Karel Appel, and Alexander Calder have taken their place. Together with Levitated Mass (1982), environmental artist Michael Heizer’s sculpture in the urban plaza at the northwest corner of East 56th Street and Madison Avenue, consisting of an 11-ton stone incised with a coded building address and resting in a stainless steel basin of rushing water, and the classic red steel Calder under the arcade overhang at the southwest corner of East 57th Street and Madison, the public spaces here have become something of a public art magnet.\nAnd, significantly, the space continues to rank high on usability. Numerous movable silver-colored chairs and granite-topped tables are scattered about the seating area, a space physically indistinguishable from the covered pedestrian space, as people form their social patterns of individual and collective activity. The food kiosk serves light lunch, snacks, and beverages, and hopefully will keep the volume of its music turned down. Even when the lack of air conditioning during the summer combines with the bamboo trees to foster a semi-tropical environment, the space is never too uncomfortable and air conditioning is just steps away at the Trump Tower and Sony covered pedestrian spaces.\nThe covered pedestrian space and seating area may be entered from both East 56th and 57th Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenues via a through block arcade that is open along its eastern side to the spaces, from the northwest corner of East 56th Street and Madison Avenue via the urban plaza, and through a passageway from Trump Tower and Niketown from the west. Together with Sony’s through-block covered pedestrian space across East 56th Street, the through block arcade creates one of the City’s six mid-block pedestrian networks. Together with the passageway connecting to Niketown and Trump Tower’s covered pedestrian space, it is possible to reach Fifth Avenue. Indeed, the combination of 590 Madison Avenue and Trump Tower creates the City’s only complex of indoor connected privately owned public spaces uninterrupted by a street, and provides an instructive contrast between a covered pedestrian space largely defined by commercial and one defined by largely non-commercial qualities.\nSeveral other changes have occurred over the years. The IBM Gallery of Science and Art that once hosted such exhibits as “American Paintings from the Toledo Museum of Art” and “Manet to Matisse: The Maurice Wertheim Collection,” has been replaced by the Newseum, a media museum funded by the Freedom Forum. The New York Botanical Gardens branch store is closed. The space has a new name, 590 Atrium, but in the hearts and minds of its loyal users, it will continue to be known as the IBM space.\n"

The space is best entered through the two small public pedestrian circulation area spaces, up several steps from Maiden Lane or at grade from Nassau Street. Inside is a tall chamber, framed by heavy-set brick arches and four overhead hanging golden metal globes with a smaller globe in between. Movable chairs are scattered about in clusters of three, and several planters are arrayed near the walls.\nThe John Street end of the space is hard to understand until its history is revealed. Escalators descend to a lower level, which provides an entrance to the Fulton Street and Broadway/Nassau subway station. Years ago, this level also housed a satellite branch of uptown’s Whitney Museum of American Art, similar in concept to the one still operating at the Philip Morris covered pedestrian space across from Grand Central Terminal. A trace of art, a Fernand Leger piece entitled The Circus (1954), with its cacophony of blue, red, beige, black, and turquoise colors depicting circus performers, remained for a while after the Whitney vacated the space. Stairs ascend out to John Street.\n"

            "details": "Like the neighboring plaza at the Grace building one block north, this special permit plaza experienced some problematic spillover from the Times Square neighborhood in the 1980s, problems that have largely disappeared with the area’s dramatic revitalization. Unlike the situation at Grace plaza, however, the owners here successfully obtained City approval for upgrading their plaza in 1989 and 1990, in return for permission to install gates at both ends for nighttime closing. The design changes, including new amenities, have produced a more usable space for members of the public. Indeed, even with the overwhelming competition presented by the City-owned Bryant Park directly across Sixth Avenue, this space still attracts it share of users.\nLocated immediately west of the dark glass Bell Atlantic tower occupying the western blockfront of Sixth Avenue between West 41st and 42nd Streets, this large, brick, through-block rectangular plaza is entered up several steps from either side street. Most of the amenities are concentrated along the western side, across from the tower. These include two raised groves of mature trees with ivy and shrub undergrowth at the north and south ends, granite benches with uncomfortably obtuse angled backs built into the base of the groves, plentiful fixed metal benches and seats which replaced the previous plastic modular seating units, and individual trees in small concrete planters. A trellis offers shade between the two groves. The brick waterfalls and pools that used to operate here have been removed. No record of City approval for their absence has been found. More benches and concrete planters are set out next to the two entrances to the building on the eastern edge of the space. Like a baseball field at a late afternoon game, the plaza can become sharply divided between sunny and shady areas, and user patterns reflect the search for or evasion of sun. The subway concourse below the street is accessible from northeast and southwest corners of the space.\n"

Circles and curves are the ruling geometric motif. A disk-shaped paving pattern laid into the main portion of the plaza on Waverly Place is echoed in the three high-backed, cone-shaped, concrete planters with benches and two built-in concrete benches in the adjacent arcade. The perimeter planter with sittable ledge undulates sympathetically to the planters and fountain near the street corner.\nAccess to the space is available at two points. A canopied entrance path for building residents cuts through the northernmost corner of the space from Mercer Street, and a gated entryway from Waverly Place at the southernmost corner is also available. Since the space is required to be open 24 hours a day, the gate is superfluous.\nWith its plentiful seating, the plaza offers numerous vantage points for studying the historic architecture of the neighborhood. The four smaller buildings southeast across Waverly Place and Broadway display a varied vocabulary of façade embellishment and fenestration, while the massive building across Waverly Place offers impressively rusticated pilasters on its lower floors.\n"

            "details": "This covered plaza, a two-story skylit atrium, furnishes a required amenity unique among the City’s privately owned public spaces: a “climbing wall,” near the entrance at the west side of Broadway between West 62nd and West 63 rd Streets. Dotted with variously shaped stone foot- and hand-holds, the wall accommodates several climbers at a time, under the supervision of a climbing club whose office is several feet away. An audience of onlookers customarily gathers at green plastic café tables and chairs to enjoy the action and refreshments available from a coffee bar/food service counter. At a recent site visit, the required food service was not operating, and no record of City approval for such a lapse has been found. Completing the entertainment should be a one-hour weekly musical or similar performance. A sign of the times prohibits smoking, sleeping, shopping carts, excessively large packages or bundles, and sitting on the floors or heating vents.\nThe new liveliness of the space is the product of a design makeover negotiated between the City and the owner in the mid-1990s. A previous incarnation sported a pop art motif, including a serpentine seating apparatus, garish colors, and rakish painted letters, that was dated the moment it was installed. Operation was a problem, and the space was cited by the City for violations related to lighting, access, tree planting, and improper use. In 1986, 1992, and 1995, the City and owner agreed to modifications, and the latest design is an enormous improvement over the old. One part of the space continues to cause problems, however. A small second-floor area above the entrance at Columbus Avenue, accessible from inside by stairs, is required to be open and to furnish 43 chairs and seven tables. At a recent site visit, however, the stairs were blocked. Access to this second-floor area does not have to depend on the existence of an adjacent restaurant tenant and thus should be available at all times the covered plaza is open.\nThe Special Lincoln Square District zoning refers to this space, as well as three others, at 30 Lincoln Plaza, 2 Lincoln Square, and 1991 Broadway, as covered plazas. From a non-legal point of view, however, it is less clear what makes them covered plazas, especially since two out of the four are fully indoors and no different from a common-sense definition of a covered pedestrian space. At least here and at 30 Lincoln Plaza, the space is covered, yet to some degree open to the air, maintaining a vague connection to the concept of plaza. The Broadway and Columbus Avenue entrances have glass enclosures that are allowed to be lowered only from October 15th to April 15th, and even then must be raised if the daytime temperature exceeds 60 degrees fahrenheit. The space also has an entry point from the north side of West 62nd Street between Broadway and Columbus Avenue.\n"

            "details": "Depending on the time of day, this mid-block, through-block covered pedestrian space connecting Wall and Pine Streets between William and Pearl Streets assumes different personalities. At morning and late afternoon rush hours, it is a crowded corridor filled with employees going to and from the Wall Street subway station escalator and stairs located at the northwest corner. At lunch hour, it is packed with individuals sitting at the numerous metal movable tables and chairs while enjoying the wares of the various food outlets lining the eastern edge. During the rest of the day, the space enjoys a relative calm, used but never overused, by people ranging from apparently homeless to bike messenger to employee on a break. As one of only two fully enclosed, amenity-rich indoor spaces in lower Manhattan — the other is 180 Maiden Lane — it is virtually of axiomatic benefit to the neighborhood.\n\nAfter plying the narrow streets of downtown’s financial district, the visitor is surprised by the space’s openness. Its substantial height, width, and length make it one of the largest single floors belonging to any covered pedestrian space in the city. The designer’s heavy reliance on white materials and decorative elements, such as white marble brick-shaped tiles on stand-alone and attached columns, white lattice covering walls and ceiling, and even bit-sized mirrors reflecting more white, enhances the sense of openness. At the same time, the wan color and a lighting scheme that drains life from everything it touches casts something of an antiseptic pall. Beneficial as the space may be, it is not Wall Street’s intimate public living room. If anything, the space has overtones of a New York City white-tiled subway station or a stage set for an English garden.\nThe covered pedestrian space divides itself into three usable areas. The middle portion is devoted strictly to circulation, defined by columns on either side that rise from the patterned granite floor and unfurl flowerlike toward the ceiling. Generously supplied with white movable tables and chairs, sittable ledges at the base of the columns, and benches attached to the wall, the western portion receives its greatest use from people staying for more than a brief moment. Set against the western wall are large primeval-looking stone sculptures that weep water into a base filled with plants.\nAt the opposite end of the space are more white tables and chairs mostly used by patrons of the various food vendors. Here, the sense of turnover is palpable as people scarf down breakfast, lunch, or coffee before moving to their next engagement. Non-food retail stores are located closer to Wall Street. At the northeast corner of the covered pedestrian space is an entrance to the office building, as well as access to the public restrooms. Asking building management for directions to the public restrooms does not always yield a helpful response, as recent site visits have revealed, so it may be necessary to ask again, with the air of someone who knows that the restrooms exist and who displays an urgency to use them.\nA long arcade along the entire building frontage on Wall Street and a shorter stretch of arcade on Pine Street create covered entry portals to the covered pedestrian space.\n"

From East 58th Street, the journey is also up steps, down a walkway, under the building, and, reversing course, up more steps.\nThe focal point of the concrete-paved terrace is a skeletal black steel gazebo. Because it is uncovered on top and sides, its value is aesthetic rather than functional. Well-manicured landscaping in brick planters with ledge seating encircles the gazebo, and the four terrace corners are occupied by planters with more trees, shrubs, and ground cover. The overall image is precise, although the user might long for something like movable tables and chairs that allow for personalization of the space. The remainder of the plaza and an arcade wrap around the residential building along Second Avenue and the south side of East 59th Street. Some of the planter ledges here have spikes. A small portion of plaza is actually under the building edge closest to East 58th Street.\n"

From the sidewalk, the space is only partly visible, substantially hidden behind planters overflowing with a variety of mature trees, shrubs, and groundcover. Three openings on East 24th Street and one from Lexington Avenue provide access. Inside, five locations of wooden benches nestled along variously shaped brick planters satisfy the range of user preferences for sunny, shady, public, or semi-public experiences. Indeed, for such a small space, the diversity of experience is unusual. Along Lexington Avenue, a canopy and a row of small movable planters define the residential entrance corridor, although it is possible to go from the corridor directly into the space.\n"

Looking down at the space from the sidewalk, the plaza layout appears mazelike among the hedges. Narrow stairwells along the sidewalk perimeter provide access, although at a recent site visit, most of these stairwells were blocked by metal wire gates. No record of City approval for closing any of its entrances has been located.\nGiven the large footprints of the planters, open space is scarce. Parklike benches nestled within planter ledges along western and northern borders, and two round benches at the eastern side next to the building lobby supply seating. At the rear and to the east is visual residual space that ultimately leads to a sports club at the back of the building. A stone sculpture is next to the building entrance on East 96th Street. Along Third Avenue is a sliver of usable residual space and some visual residual space going around the corner to East 97th Street.\n"

            "details": "At the northeast corner of Second Avenue and East 43rd Street is this small, pleasant, rectangular residential plaza. When it first appeared in the mid-1980s, the space suffered from construction newness. Gangly trees and plantings did not adequately break the sparse expanse of red brick extending from building edge to street curb. Now, however, time has allowed the trees to grow bigger and taller, and the building owner has wisely installed additional tree- and ivy-filled planters, resulting in a healthier balance between natural and constructed materials.\nOther design touches continue to work well. By staying at sidewalk grade level and resisting the impulse to treat the plaza frontage along East 43rd Street differently from the public sidewalk, the space comes across as immediate and accessible. Fixed wire-mesh seating to the east and northeast, and ledge seating on interior and exterior sides of the triangular planter along the avenue, are comfortable, spacious, and inviting. The adjacent ground-floor retail space has active, transparent store windows rather than dead, opaque walls. Although the red-canopied corridor leading to the front door on the eastern side is segregated from the rest of the public space, it is clear that this building has not disowned its plaza.\n"

            "details": "The “before” and “after” renditions of this residential plaza surrounding the three street frontages of Plymouth Tower on East 92nd Street, the west side of First Avenue, and East 93rd Street, provide a powerful demonstration of the differences between plazas built under the less demanding 1961 “as-of-right” plaza zoning rules and plazas built under the more demanding residential plaza regulations enacted in 1977. In this case, the before refers uncomfortably to a multiyear time period from the building’s completion date until 1987 during which the space satisfied only the “as-of-right” plaza standards even though it was obligated to meet the residential plaza standards. Upon discovery of this discrepancy, a special permit was approved requiring fulfillment of the residential plaza rules with several modifications.\nThe upgraded portions of the space are especially visible on East 93rd and 92nd Streets. Previously, the rectangular space west of the building on East 93rd Street was blocked to the public by planters and, in any event, had no usable amenities beyond the blockade. Now, the space is open and usable, and the theme is a garden. The two concrete walls to the east and south and the garage ramp to the west are camouflaged by a decorative green trellis. A green, metal-framed hut structure in back, dubbed a gazebo, shelters one of three wood teak benches that are more usually located in romantic country gardens. At a recent site visit, however, only two of three required teak benches were provided, and no record of City approval for changes in required seating has been found. Plentiful wide ledge seating adorns the planters.\nCloser to First Avenue, mini-gardens flank the minimalist, partially canopied drop-off driveway. Unfortunately, two required teak wood benches were missing at a recent site visit without a record of City approval, even if planters provide additional seating. On the north side of East 92nd Street is a sliver of residential plaza with backless, concrete planter seating and landscaping. Two required teak benches were also missing here at a recent site visit, with no record of City approval. The residential plaza space along First Avenue is extra sidewalk in front of retail facilities.\n"

            "details": "The best aspect of this residential plaza is its success at serving equally well the passing pedestrian and the committed user. The major portion of the space forms a triangle, whose right angle sits at the northeast corner of First Avenue and East 36th Street and whose hypotenuse is the building itself. Without ever entering the space, the pedestrian walking along the avenue is able to experience the visual, psychological, even actual coolness of the ornamental fountain located adjacent to the sidewalk. Unlike the more common plan at many city plazas, this layout features the fountain front and center rather than buried deep within. Water shoots up, then overflows downward from bowl to larger bowl to still larger bowl, redolent of beaux arts fountains. Physical access is available up two steps from the sidewalk side of the space. The pedestrian may prolong the moment of refreshment by sitting on the fixed bench built into the sidewalk side of a planter surrounding the fountain.\nFor those seeking to stay, the plaza presents a different face, down 10 steps past the fountain or entered at grade from East 36th Street. Formally disengaged from the avenue by the grade-level change and buffered by fountain to the west and planters to the south, the space still manages to elude the cramped, isolated feeling generated by many other below-grade spaces. It is relatively spacious, unobstructed by planters, and, most importantly, open to the horizon to the west. The presence of the wide swath of access roads leading to the Midtown Tunnel not only precludes buildings that would encroach on the spaciousness of sky, but allows for a sighting of the Empire State building.\nUsable amenities are plentiful. Four polished granite benches and brick planter ledges supply many places to sit. A round reflecting pool is surrounded by eight cork-shaped polished granite seats. The interior of the fountain reveals a lower waterfall below the three upper bowls. Trees and plants generously fill their host planters, and the buff-colored paving brick softens the space and merges it with the façade of the building. The rest of the plaza also works well. A landing five steps above the northern portion of the avenue side fronts storefronts and a café. At a recent site visit, white café tables and chairs were set out on part of the landing, but no record of City approval for such use has been found. The East 37th Street plaza space is pleasantly landscaped with a row of trees and plantings.\n"

            "details": "Successor owners to the original developer of this Broadway office tower have faced an inherently problematic site condition at their full blockfront special permit plaza on the west side of Broadway between West 50th and 51st Streets: two square holes punched into its north and south ends creating sunken spaces. Over the years, the square holes have dramatically dissipated the physical integrity of the surface plaza, reducing it to little more than interstitial space between and around the squares. Moreover, positioned one floor below the street and approachable only by stairs, these sunken spaces have never worked on their own terms. Neither offered a reason to stay, lacking functional seating and other public space amenities. Surrounding storefronts were either occupied by non-retail commercial uses or restaurants that went out of business, or were simply vacant, behind opaque black glass windows displaying “for rent” signs. Much of the northern sunken space was covered by an ornamental fountain rendered unapproachable by a cordon of white planters. Although the southern space at least offered a reason to pass through it, a subway entry, it lacked a reason to stop. The ornamental fountain here was no more appealing than in the northern space.\n\nSunken spaces have always presented difficulties and their pathology is not hard to discern. Compared with street-level spaces, sunken spaces require greater effort on the part of the public to reach them. They are frequently dark and cold, lacking sunlight more available at street level. Without the eyes and ears of pedestrians, they can be downright scary. Without usable amenities and supportive retail uses, they can be dead. Even the skating rink at Rockefeller Center, typologically a sunken space, might be less successful were it not covered with ice for skating during the winter or fully engaged for summertime use. The empirical record of sunken spaces in the city is not a happy one. Of the five outdoor privately owned public spaces with prominent sunken areas created since 1961, one has completely disappeared, at 1345 Sixth Avenue and another is about to disappear, at the General Motors Building at Trump International Plaza. The McGraw-Hill sunken plaza and the Citigroup Center open air concourse remain.\nOver the past 10 years, the owner here has undertaken two alterations to address subsurface and surface conditions. It has removed the fountains and installed in the northern space a flying saucer sculpture, a bench and fixed seats, and a lift mechanism. Active retail uses and restaurants have been promised. The southern space will always have the advantage of subway access through an underground concourse, and the owner has left that space to its circulation mission. Befitting its Broadway location, the street-level plaza has been made more theatrical, boasting banners, high-tech lights, and a silver identification marquee. Fixed benches flank the central entryway between the two sunken spaces, and small planters peppering the middle are the latest strategy for filling in the interstices. More plaza space extends into the recessed areas of the building on West 50th and 51st Streets.\nAnother public space is a special permit arcade running through-block under the building between Broadway and Eighth Avenue connecting West 50th and 51st Streets. It should not be confused with the through-block dropoff driveway immediately west. Pedestrian and automobile access at this location is important to service the two theaters, encouraged by the 1967 Special Theatre District zoning, occupying lower levels of the tower.\n"

            "details": "This half-sunken residential plaza on the north side of East 71st Street between the F.D.R. Drive and York Avenue belies the conventional wisdom that below-grade spaces are necessarily dark and depressing. Good design is key. The space is a capacious courtyard covered in an inviting reddish brick. Its unusually wide and unobstructed street frontage guarantees that sunlight reaches some or all of the space during the day. A steady stream of people entering and exiting the hospital north enlivens the plaza and ensures that it never depends exclusively on its own qualities to generate pedestrian traffic. And, to be fair, the space is only seven steps below the sidewalk, not so deep as some of the less successful truly sunken plazas, for example, those at Paramount Plaza.\nA mushroom-shaped polished granite fountain and pink-tinted pool occupy the center. The ledge deserves special praise as one of the few in the City’s public space inventory that allows users to drape their legs comfortably in the water. Nearby planters stocked with mature trees, flowers, and ground cover echo the curve of the fountain, and provide plentiful seating themselves on attached polished granite benches. The landscaped western edge has one of the longest linear stretches of polished granite bench to be found in any public space. When the sun bakes this side before moving eastward, users either abandon or descend upon the bench. The eastern side is crowded with movable glass-topped white tables and chairs that often find their way to other parts of the space. A café provides takeout food.\nTwo plaques are located at the top of the stairs, east on a planter wall. One dedicates the plaza to Mildred Hilson for her devoted service to the Hospital for Special Surgery; the other is the public space plaque. Ironically, the only evidence of sloppy maintenance at this space is the public space plaque, which is dull to the point of illegibility. The Mildred Hilson plaque is shiny and legible.\n"

Another uncertainty is its ultimate size. A 1989 restrictive declaration filed by the developer and governing development of this site states that the required size of the public open space will vary depending on how much commercial space is ultimately developed. If more than 25 percent of the development’s overall floor area is commercial, then a minimum of 30,000 square feet of public open space must be supplied. If 25 percent or less of the overall floor area is commercial, then a minimum of 21,000 square feet of public open space must be provided. Since only the construction of the development’s first building is underway, and the final project size has yet to be definitively established, the final required size of the public open space cannot be stated with certainty. The information presented in this profile, on required size, access, and amenities, is based on plans submitted by the developer to the Department of City Planning for purposes of demonstrating that the public open space would comply with provisions of the restrictive declaration. Requirements for the public open space may change in the future depending on the nature of the final development.\nThe triangle of space denominated “interim landscaping” is interim until another building to the east is constructed, at which time that area will be occupied by the building.\n"

            "details": "Enclosed on three sides by the nineteenth-century Italianate landmark Villard Houses, this formal European-style courtyard on the east side of Madison Avenue between East 50th and 51st Streets may be described as the oldest privately owned public space in the city. The City Planning Commission in 1976 approved a floor area bonus and additional regulatory concessions for a new hotel, to be built east of the courtyard, if the developer agreed to preserve the Villard Houses, open the courtyard to public use, allow pedestrian circulation through their hotel lobby, and conduct public tours of the landmark building interior. The general success of this courtyard in serving public and private interests demonstrates that historic buildings, as well as newly constructed ones, should be understood as candidates for providing exterior and interior public space. The atrium space in the approved permanent passageway at 712 Fifth Avenue is another example, even as it struggles with issues of public access and private use.\nEntered from Madison Avenue through a high wrought-iron gate, the courtyard is a model of comfortable horizontal and vertical proportions. The height of surrounding façades, roughly three-and-a-half stories, matches with the courtyard floor space, and the stone back of Saint Patrick’s Cathedral across Madison Avenue adds to the effect. Completed in 1885 for railroad magnate Henry Villard, the chocolate-colored stone compound seamlessly integrates what were six townhouses to evoke the appearance of a Roman palazzo, specifically the Palazzo della Cancelleria, which designer Joseph Wells of McKim, Mead & White took as precedent. The modern hotel tower is sufficiently set back on the lot, behind the arched arcade, that its presence is virtually unnoticed from within the courtyard itself. The stone paving employs a pattern of swirling circles. Trees grow in four large planters decorated with medallions. Black-metal tables and chairs are set up throughout, but, in the sole act of privatization, those near the southern end are used by the adjacent world-famous restaurant. No record of City approval for such use has been found. Nor is there any explanation for the absence of a required fountain and reflecting pool.\nPreservation of the Villard Houses under the watchful eyes of the Landmarks Preservation Commission and City Planning Commission was one of the city’s great landmark preservation triumphs. It also served as one of the earliest brushes with a partial “façadectomy,” a controversial historic preservation technique in which a landmark’s façade is preserved by tacking it onto the face of a new building while the rest of the structure and its historic use are lost. Here, substantially more than façade was preserved, and the owner is obligated to provide public tours of the significant interior rooms at least six times a year. North and south wings enclosing the courtyard are fully preserved. Known as the Urban Center, the north wing houses exhibition galleries and a bookstore on the first floor, as well as office space for the Municipal Art Society of New York, the Architectural League, and the Parks Council, on upper floors. The south wing is used by the restaurant. The public is also legally entitled to pass through the hotel lobby, from East 50th and 51st Street entrances, as well as from the courtyard, Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.\n"

Named after one of the city’s prominent real estate families and the building’s developer, Fisher Park has been upgraded since its initial appearance in 1968, most recently as part of its successful application for City approval of an open air café along West 55th Street.\nThe results are good and the space is heavily used during the summer months. The rear plaza is elevated several steps above each of its flanking sidewalks. A long rectangular pool with comfortable seating ledge on the western side is arrayed with four rows of 13 water jets each that increase in height from front to back. Hovering over the space is a colorful fabric sculpture resembling a kite with three sails in red, white, and blue. Fixed tables and chairs surround three tree-filled planters with sittable wooden ledges at the northern end, while the southern end has four more planters with sittable ledges. In an age of cell phones, the pay phones stationed in front of north and south entrances may become redundant.\nThe remaining plaza space encircles the building. On Sixth Avenue are two flanking pools and fountains with sculptures at north and south ends. Four benches are placed next to the pools. The plaza on West 55th Street accommodates the open air café with table seating, while the West 54th Street side is lined with trees and planters.\n"

            "details": "Located at the northwest corner of East 49th Street and Second Avenue, this compact, park-like residential plaza furnishes a welcome physical and psychological break from the busy restaurant and retail sidewalk activity along Second Avenue. Trees grow out of its red-tiled floor, while a triangular planter with landscaping provides more trees. Two wooden benches accommodate three persons each, and the planter’s undulating hypotenuse ledge catches the overflow. Small touches, such as antique-style lampposts, demonstrate thoughtfulness of design. Standing guard at the southern edge, a tall painted aluminum-plate sculpture entitled Companions (1985), by William King, is meant to represent two friends greeting each other. The very compactness of the space does encourage users to interact with one another.\nThe accommodation of “insider” and “outsider” interests, especially at residential buildings, is constantly tested at public spaces. Here, building residents enter their lobby by way of a canopied passage within the visual residual portion of the residential plaza that is physically and visually separated from the rest of the space by a row of trees and landscaping. Thus, by design, Sterling Plaza has made a strong point distinguishing between private and public functionality. Sometimes such separation can be indicative of management’s disavowal of public space, but no such disavowal is evident here. The maintenance of the plaza is consistently exemplary and building residents are found in the space along with members of the public. As one resident recounts, “I figured it was public, because there are strange people here all the time that don’t live in the building. It’s okay. It doesn’t bother me to have it as part of my building. It’s nice to come out here when it’s sunny.”\n"

            "details": "Located on the north side of East 54th Street between Sutton Place South and First Avenue, this well-designed residential plaza marshals comfortable proportions, quality materials, and favored amenities to produce its calm ambiance. The user is invited into the space by its strong physical connection with the outside. The public sidewalk and plaza use the same brick pavers, and generally maintain the same grade level, like the plaza-sidewalk relationship at River Tower across the street. The metal fence and lattice column-plank structure on the perimeter delineate without dividing. Enclosed on three sides, the space has a width and depth easily absorbed at a glance. The public space plaque is cheerfully visible to the west, unlike some plaques that display a passive-aggressive attitude toward public use by announcing a space’s publicness behind creeping vines and overgrown shrubs in out-of-the-way locations.\nThree sextagonal, wooden-slat benches with trees in their middle occupy the foreground near the entrance, providing visual interest and convenient seating front and center in an area normally treated as a void. More wood benches and planters alternate with one another in front of the tall brick wall to the west, and a single planter with trees and shrubs frames the back.\nThe eastern side is taken up with a complex water feature and abundant landscaping, best viewed from the northeast corner of the space. Four lollipop-shaped bubblers and channels discharge rivulets of water into a moat fronting the glass-enclosed building lobby, creating the illusion that the water flows directly into the building and connects to an interior water pool. Even though residents do not walk through the space to reach their lobby, the glass wall ensures their attention on a daily basis. The space’s high level of maintenance speaks to management’s ongoing stewardship. Usable residual plaza, with several benches and trees, is located in front of the East 55th Street side of the building. Some residential neighborhoods are lucky to have one good space. This one-block stretch enjoys two residential plazas that meet some of the highest standards found in residential plaza design and maintenance. It is almost unfair.\n"

            "details": "Of the three buildings with plazas and some variation of Murray Hill in their names — Murray Hill and Murray Hill House are the others — Murray Hill Mews provides the greatest amount of potentially usable plaza. The word potentially is necessary because an adjacent restaurant, legally authorized to place tables and chairs on the space, too often fails to operate in ways that make clear to members of the public that they may sit without obligation to purchase anything.\nThe plaza encircles the building at lower and upper levels, along East 37th Street, the west side of Third Avenue, East 38th Street, and most of the tower’s west side. Entered up stairs from East 37th or 38th Streets 75 feet west of Third Avenue, the upper-level plaza is a capacious balcony ringed by three-foot walls that block the sight and much of the noise of the streets below. With its pavement recently brightened, it has a lean, clean look that shines when the sun is out.\nDuring the summer, a restaurant spills its tables and chairs onto the upper-level East 37th Street side under authority granted by a Board of Standards and Appeals variance. That variance also guarantees that members of the public may sit anywhere without obligation. In the past, however, the restaurant’s arrangement and management of the seating areas have muddied the waters with regard to this public guarantee.\nAt a recent site visit, for example, one dubious configuration situated three small, unshaded tables along the southern balcony wall, segregated from the bulk of seating nearer the restaurant that was distinguished by oversized red umbrellas and waiter service. This two-zone grouping could easily suggest to members of the public that the three outlying tables were the public ones, while the other tables were private.\nIn addition, required signs stating that the plaza is “Open to public 9 am to sunset,” were missing, with glue marks on columns the only evidence of their former existence here. Remaining signs stating “tables available for public use” were displayed on the three outlying tables, further implying that the other tables were not. Such implication becomes explicit privatization when waiters inform individuals that they may not sit in the restaurant-area chairs without purchasing food and drink, as they did at a recent site visit.\nOther aspects of the space are also disappointing. At a recent site visit, required fixed wooden benches and planters were missing on both East 37th and 38th Street sides, and the Third Avenue upper-level space connecting north and south sides was fenced off from public access. No record of City approval has been found for these discrepancies from legal requirements. The remaining lower-level portion of the space on Third Avenue is an empty strip several steps below the adjacent public sidewalk in front of stores. In the past, another restaurant has set up chairs and tables here, but the public would have the same right to sit without obligation to purchase as it does in the upper-level plaza. The through-block driveway west of the building, and the waterfall and fountain in front of the primary residential entrance there, are genuinely private space.\n"

The portion of space closest to West 61st Street has an appealing openness about it. Flanked by the building and a rock garden to the east and a row of trees and low landscaping to the west, the rectangle provides two large, round, wooden benches and rows of trees growing directly out of its purplish-brick paving.\nCurling east around the back of the tower and descending several steps is the most curious part of the public space here. A small stepped waterfall funnels water into a pool in front of a lower-level, glass-enclosed room. Above this room is additional residential plaza, an elevated terrace garden, complete with wooden trellis, accessible up a stairwell located in the adjacent arcade. At a recent site visit, the water was not operating and the stairwell was obstructed by a locked gate at hours that it should be open. No record of City approval for these discrepancies has been found.

            "details": "Located on the north side of East 40th Street between Second and Third Avenues, the primary space of this well-designed residential plaza subtly allocates its spatial geography into a through traffic area for building residents and a passive recreational area for members of the public as well as building residents, without creating that balkanized us versus them environment evident in some residential plazas. The plan employs three critical elements to achieve this detente. First, although the ultimate destinations may be different, private and public users still enter and exit through the same opening. Second, the two areas, while spatially separate, are transparently visible to users in one or the other. Third, the two areas are unified by application of identical paving patterns and similar materials.\nWarmed by the southern exposure, the sidewalk side of the eastern half of the plaza supplies a polished granite seating ledge used through much of the day. The plaza opening further west is entered around either side of a round brick planter, once filled with colorful annuals, now filled with green shrubs and limned with spiked ledge. For residents, the wide walkway continues north, sloping upward until it reaches the building’s front door. For the public as well as residents, up several steps to the east, is a shady, parklike, intimate, and well-proportioned space delineated by low-rise planters at its western edge and variously sized trees and plants at eastern and southern perimeters. Trees at the center are surrounded by two rows of fixed, curving wire-mesh chairs, facing north or west, furnishing comfortable, albeit limited, seating opportunities. Granite seating ledges and planters on the sidewalk perimeter of the visual residual space are supplied on East 41st Street.\n"

            "details": "More than any other residential plaza in the city, this residential plaza successfully emulates many of the attributes of the time-honored urban neighborhood public park, providing both active recreational opportunities for neighborhood kids and passive recreational opportunities for neighborhood adults. The plaza takes up roughly the western third of the building’s full-block parcel, bounded by the east side of First Avenue, by East 34th and 35th Streets, and by the Rivergate tower to the east. Entry points are found along First Avenue and East 34th Street. The entrance from East 34th Street is especially convincing, framing the entrant’s view with a foreground of flowers, a mid-ground of lawn, and a background of basketball backboard and rim, all on axis.\nThe plaza is oriented north-south rather than east-west, dividing itself into two functionally distinct zones. The larger southern zone is dedicated to passive recreation, featuring a landscaped rectangle with eased corners and indented side, close to an oval. In its middle is a lush greensward surrounded by small trees, shrubs, and colorful annuals. A brick track encircling the lawn is perfect for circuit walking and jogging, even though such activities might jar the passive recreational environment of this quiet zone. At north and south ends are wooden benches hung from curving brick planter walls, and additional freestanding benches are found steps up to the west, next to the drinking fountain and food kiosk.\nTo the north are a basketball half-court used by teenagers and adults and a children’s rubber-paved playground with climbable play-structures, the remaining parts of a much larger effort to enable active recreation. In 1996, the City allowed the removal of several sports-based amenities, including an ice skating rink, a warmup and fitness area, and several chess tables. The ice skating rink was a good idea, designed to provide life to an outdoor space during the winter, a time when almost all of the City’s outdoor privately owned public spaces lie dormant. Indeed, for a city in a northern climate, the provision of winter amenities at public spaces makes enormous sense. Unfortunately, the ice rink here may have attracted skaters, but failed as an ultimate magnet for onlookers. If the model was, in some sense, the rinks at Rockefeller Center and Central Park, the reality never quite measured up. A minor, but interesting example of a winter amenity at a plaza is the combination fog-steam fountain at One Penn Plaza.\n"

            "details": "Like the special permit plaza at One Liberty Plaza downtown, only more so, a substantial section of this plaza is geographically estranged from its parent building. Over half of the total plaza area associated with the Sheffield is situated roughly 300 feet west of the building, occupying the full blockfront of Ninth Avenue’s east side between West 56th and 57th Streets.\nFor about 15 years, the northern portion of this plaza space has hosted a popular year-round outdoor greenmarket, sponsored by the City’s Council on the Environment, on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. Residents and out-of-towners alike have made their way along the vendor stalls lining the public sidewalk and the space, seeking moderately priced fresh fruit and vegetables, baked goods, flowers, honey, and maple syrup, mostly originating from New York and surrounding states, as well as books and records. A particular favorite has been a woman selling dramatic, immense sunflowers. Vaguely reminiscent of outdoor Parisian markets, the greenmarket has become a neighborhood gathering place where relationships between regular customers and long-time vendors have been cemented.\nIn recent years, however, aspects of the space, especially in the non-market eastern and southern portions, have deteriorated. Some of this has been due to the natural aging process experienced by all privately owned public spaces, while some has been due to the materials, particularly the concrete and shrubbery, that require aggressive maintenance and cleaning if they are not to look worn over time. Another reason is the existence of the stepped concrete amphitheater in the middle of the eastern portion of the space, never animated by consistent programming necessary to make such elements work. And finally, the space was a geographical orphan, so far removed from its parent to the east that it would always be difficult to receive the type of oversight that large spaces require.\nThat situation is now ending. As this book is being written, the space is undergoing a substantial renovation. The greenmarket along Ninth Avenue will be retained, but everything else will change. As a result of cooperative efforts of the part of the owner, the Department of City Planning, and community representatives, the space is being physically reinvented under a new design that features usable landscapes and varied functional amenities. A generously sized stepped lawn will replace the amphitheater, and a garden and trees bordering the eastern boundary will enhance the naturalistic qualities. In addition to the lawn, seating will be available on a curving ledge, on benches, and on movable chairs matched with movable tables. A food kiosk and café terrace at the corner of Ninth Avenue and West 57th Street, a bookseller on West 57th Street, and a tot lot in the middle will help assure a diverse mix of users at different hours of the day. At night, the space will be authorized to close, at 9:00 pm during the summer and at 7:00 pm during the winter. In an enlightened and unusual show of respect for its designer, the space will be named after Thomas Balsley, whose landscape architecture firm has designed or redesigned more privately owned public spaces in the city than any other firm.\nSeveral hundred feet to the east, the remaining plaza space runs through-block between West 56th and 57th Streets, immediately west of the Sheffield. A through-block driveway uses the eastern portion, while usable space, including a small area hidden mid-block, occupies the western portion. Here are six wooden benches alongside planters with trees and bushes, and a surprisingly open view to the west over the wall. An empty pedestal is the only reminder of a modernist polished metal sculpture by D. Durst. In the past, this tiny area has been used by young bicyclists taking advantage of the slight elevation changes to perfect “freestyle” tricks.\nBenches and planters are located under and near the slightly elevated arcade on West 56th Street. More arcade space is found at the main entrance and on West 57th Street.\n"

When the sun bakes the open, south-facing portion of the primary space along East 95th Street, its brick surface could probably fry an egg. The planter next to the public sidewalk and the flanking trees do little to moderate the combustible union of open brick surface and unobstructed sun. The three-level brick-backed waterfall installed at the western edge of the space helps dramatically, however, as users at ground level may sit on surrounding ledges and cool themselves off. Other seating at the space is problematic. The space is required to provide at least 494.1 linear feet of seating. At a recent site visit, the exterior planter ledge on East 95th Street had a metal spiked railing, as did the ledges of the two planters in the primary space along Second Avenue. No record of City approval that would allow a reduction of required seating has been found. Usable residual space is located on East 96th Street, where small grassy areas flank both sides of the building entrance. The space located west of the waterfall offers an interesting bird’s-eye view of this space below, but is not part of the public space here.\n"

The inconspicuous street entrances and the awkward passage down multiple steps hardly foretell, psychologically or visually, the presence of an eight-story atrium inside. The absence of significant retail tenants or subway access also keeps outside knowledge of the space to a minimum, eroding any reason to visit. Unlike neighboring covered pedestrian spaces at Trump Tower, 590 Madison Avenue, and Sony, this space is not visible from without, flashy from within, or active. Its brown-and-purple color palette, spare natural and artificial illumination, and constrained verticality generate a subdued atmosphere.\nThe City has worked with the owner to enliven the space, approving the installation of a permanent food kiosk at the eastern edge and additional private restaurant seating along the western wall near the waterfall. Unlike the plentiful tables and chairs near the food kiosk, most recently a delicatessen counter, usable by the public without obligation, the restaurant seating is for paying patrons only. As with the installation of open air cafés in outdoor spaces, it may be sensible at times to permit, even encourage, the private use of a portion of interior public space if it improves the overall environment of the space and in the end enhances overall public use. At the Galleria, this is certainly one of several strategies to be pursued. Others could include new retail and design initiatives.\n"

            "details": "Entered up five steps from the north side of East 93rd Street slightly west of First Avenue, the plaza is a deep rectangle, enclosed on all but the street side, extending from the sidewalk directly to the lobby of the residential tower. Although constructed two years before the 1977 residential plaza standards were enacted, the developer nonetheless agreed to meet higher standards than those governing the typical “as-of-right” plaza in return for a special permit granted by the City Planning Commission allowing modification of tower coverage rules.\nThe results, however, are hard to discern. Other than the decorative paving, everything about the space seems temporary: here today, gone tomorrow. Two movable wood bench units anchored by wood planters supply seating for several persons toward the eastern side. Rows of apparently movable wood box planters with trees occupy the western portion. Little boxes of plants are found at each side. Small lattices decorate the eastern wall. The space feels bare, as if it is still waiting to be designed. It is interesting to compare the residential plaza at Plymouth Tower directly across the street, with this plaza, to understand how different legal standards produce different physical outcomes.\nAt a recent site visit, the required water feature that had previously operated at the space was absent, as were two required tables. A gate at the street entrance suggests that the space may be closed at night. A portion of the plaza at the northwest corner of East 93rd Street and Third Avenue was fenced off and completely inaccessible. No record of City approval for any of these conditions has been located. A below-ground strip of plaza, some of which is fenced off for garbage storage, is situated on East 94th Street. A block-long special permit arcade lines the First Avenue side.\n"

Indeed, they were developed in cooperation with the City of New York Parks and Recreation Department.\nNearest West End Avenue is a sand-and-dirt overlook, furnished with six wooden benches, perfect for enjoying the view unfolding to the west. Immediately below is a fenced children’s play area. In an amusing turn, a sign admonishes, “Adults must be accompanied by children.” Entered through a single opening under a tall blue metal structure, the play area features two multicolored play units and a stone wall with five brass relief fish water sculptures. A pathway made of synthetic carpet wends its way around the perimeter, past two grassy areas, five stone boulders, six trees, and two green park lamps. Wooden benches at north and south ends accommodate the accompanied adults.\nFurther west is an expansive grass lawn whose openness is unusual for dense Manhattan. The wind whips in off the Hudson, swaying the 14 trees but leaving unmoved the huge stone boulders artistically scattered about. Three sets of wooden benches provide still more seating. A bronze sculpture of a rhinoceros on snout end, atop a boulder and watched by a nearby salamander, anchors the northeast corner. Titled Newton & Darwin (1975), by sculptor Nobi Shioya, it tells a story: “It wasn’t that the Rhino couldn’t fly – it simply had never occurred to him.” A train is heard rumbling and whistle-blowing in the distance. These unusual public spaces were a condition of a City Planning Commission special permit approving the large-scale residential development visible to the south.\n"

            "details": "The two McGraw-Hill public spaces are in the middle of the Sixth Avenue row of three colossal plazas between West 47th and 50th Streets. Together with the plazas at 1211 Sixth Avenue and 1251 Sixth Avenue, the spaces evoke significant urban planning questions explored in this book’s profile of the 1251 Sixth Avenue plaza as well as in Chapter 3. The McGraw-Hill spaces in their broad layout and relationship to the building footprint are twins of the space at 1251 Sixth Avenue. The building is set back significantly from the street, creating a large open area, and the building is recessed on its sides to create the opportunity for additional space to the west. Behind the building is a through-block space not legally required to be public but nonetheless made publicly accessible in the past by the owner.\n\nWhat distinguishes McGraw-Hill, however, is its sunken plaza, one of only three required outdoor public spaces with sunken areas remaining in the City’s public space inventory; the others are located at Paramount Plaza and the Citigroup Center. At the time of this writing, the sunken plaza in front of the General Motors Building at Trump International Plaza is being eliminated. Interestingly, the McGraw-Hill sunken space did not qualify for or generate a floor area bonus under the 1961 Zoning Resolution’s “as-of-right” plaza standards because it violated, by inches, the prohibition against plazas more than 12 feet below street level. Nonetheless, the developer obtained a City special permit granting a waiver from height and setback rules for its building, which obligated it to construct the development shown on submitted and approved plans, including this sunken plaza.\nThe top of a 50-foot-tall polished stainless steel sculpture, entitled The Sun Triangle (1973), by Athelstan Spilhaus, pierces the imaginary street-level horizontal plane. Stairs at north and south corners provide access to the base of the sculpture. The three sides of the triangle point to the four seasonal positions of the sun at solar noons. Nearby, circular decals inscribed in the granite floor elaborate on a planetary theme. Tucked against the southern stairwell is limited bench seating. Chairs and tables for a adjacent restaurant have replaced a reflecting pool and fountain. No record of City approval for this restaurant use has been found. The restaurant, an entry to a theater, and connections to the subway and Rockefeller Center’s underground concourse create traffic through the space, and some of the pedestrians stop at the bench seating during summer months.\nThe plaza at street level includes elevated terraces at north and south ends, similar to those at 1251 Sixth Avenue, with trees and benches overlooking the sunken plaza. Planters and planter benches are also located next to the building’s primary entrance on West 49th Street. When it is open, the non-required, uncovered, through-block corridor at the back of the building doubles as a pleasant lunch spot as well as the third link in an informal, non-required, four-block pedestrian chain. The West 48th Street entrance is guarded by a concrete wall, parted by a cylindrical glass tunnel entry featuring water spilling overhead and down the curving glass sides. This contemporary evocation of Moses and the Red Sea leads not to the promised land, but to an area with fixed bench seating, movable tables and chairs, small fountain and pool, exotic plants hanging on a trellis, and food service closer to West 49th Street.\n"

The rest of the space persists in its postmodern aesthetic, with exaggerated granite pilasters on side wall and matching granite paving. Other approaches to public space postmodernism are evident at 445 Fifth Avenue and 135 East 57th Street.\nAmenities are located in two principal zones. At front are four cross-shaped flower boxes surrounded by numerous green-metal café tables and chairs that receive heavy use during the midday sunlit hours. At back are a grove of six mature trees, each encircled by fixed wooden benches, a quiet water wall, and stone artwork. Users savor the serenity engendered by trees and water as they pursue principally solitary activities such as reading, thinking, or resting.\nThe public space and adjacent building to the east were developed by the United Nations Development Corporation, a quasi-public agency, within the Special United Nations Development District.\n"

            "details": "At the northwest corner of York Avenue and East 86th Street with entrances off both streets is this small, functional residential plaza. Elevated several steps above the sidewalk, this brick platform absorbs plenty of sunlight owing to its privileged location at a northwest street corner. Numerous wooden benches attached to brick planter walls are wisely oriented in a variety of directions, and users lean back in happy surrender to the sky. A design improvement would remove the metal dividers that are always meant to prevent sleeping on the benches. They accomplish that purpose, but they also regiment users into individual seats too tight for larger persons. Small trees and scrub vegetation fill the planters and help to block out street activity.\nLike the residential plaza at Sterling Plaza, for example, this plaza separates the resident’s pathway to the lobby entrance from the rest of the public space by situating it on the western edge and interposing planters. Nonetheless, an opening in the planter row close to the front door allows residents to walk through the space to the street or vice versa if they like, thereby fostering interaction between insiders and outsiders, more observation by residents, and better stewardship by management.\nOne private preference is clear. A sign prohibits ball playing, bicycle riding, skateboarding, and rollerblading, activities hard to imagine in a space less than 2,000 square feet in size with little open area. Even if it is hard to imagine the occurrence of such activities here, the sign raises an interesting question. Who determines the rules for conduct in public spaces? Is it strictly up to the owner to set them according to its own preferences as a property owner, or does the Zoning Resolution’s definition of a residential plaza as an open area for “public use” carry with it some notion of public rights as well? Under either view, reasonable rules and reasonable conduct are the touchstones.\n"

            "details": "Much of the cruciform-shaped public space at Two Lincoln Square has undergone a remarkable transformation from its inauspicious start more than 25 years ago to the current accomplished incarnation. Authorized by the Special Lincoln Square District zoning regulations, whose purpose, among other things, was to “preserve, protect and promote” the area’s character as a “unique cultural and architectural complex” and to “improve circulation patterns,” the original covered plaza lacked anything remotely cultural or architectural and would have been unlikely to divert pedestrians from their path along Columbus Avenue or the side streets. Indeed, entered from the east side of Columbus Avenue between West 65th and 66th Streets in the mid-1980s, a visitor would travel down a covered arcade, past a solitary trash can and empty retail windows, traverse a north-south passageway, and conclude several feet beyond and five steps above at an open-to-the-sky terrace with three straggly trees, a step ladder, and nothing else.\nIn the 1980s, the City commenced enforcement proceedings to revoke the building’s certificate of occupancy, citing issues relating to retail frontage, access, height, entrances, public seating, and landscaping violations. The action ultimately resulted in an accommodation with the owner, and the space today fulfills many aspects of the Special District’s original mission. Behind glass doors, the Museum of American Folk Art now occupies the entire enclosed covered plaza as a fully indoor space and exhibits several centuries of American paintings, sculptures, and furniture. The formerly outdoor terrace recently exhibited Edward Hicks’ dramatic The Peaceable Kingdom, a painting depicting images of animals, people, landscaping, and river from the Book of Isaiah, and a series of chairs rising heavenward toward a skylight.\nIn addition to the art, the space provides two wooden benches near the Columbus Avenue entrance, several chairs, an information desk, and restrooms in the southern wing that are on the opposite side of the hallway from the location indicated on the City-approved plans. The challenge here is to make sure that members of the public understand that this is, indeed, a public space that also happens to be used by a private non-profit museum. Were someone to complain that this use has usurped a public space, it would be certain that such person had never visited the covered plaza in its previous incarnation. The Museum of American Folk Art has recently announced plans to build a new facility for itself, so questions will be raised once more about the future of this space.\nA mandatory arcade required by the Special Lincoln Square District is located along Columbus Avenue, and the café near West 65th Street is a permitted use. A tiny patch of special permit plaza is found at the southeast corner of West 66th Street and Broadway. An outdoor but covered section of the covered plaza, located on West 66th Street east of Columbus Avenue, is completely unusable and looks like a loading dock, a pointed reminder of what the space used to be. Members of the public may not access the museum from here or vice versa.\n"

The lack of retail frontage, thriving landscaping, and agreeable amenities has kept the user population low. The sittable ledge around the brick planter, displaying several bushes and trees decorated year-round with Christmas lights, is almost never occupied. For years, the sign at the western front has contained a punctuation error, insisting that the space is “for the publics enjoyment.” A more serious error is its announcement of restricted hours, from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. No record of City approval for hours less than 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, has been found.\nGiven the density of midtown development, all spaces are at first appreciated. Given the competition of nearby public spaces at 780 Third Avenue and 767 Third Avenue down East 48th Street, this urban plaza in its present configuration is unlikely to be a user’s first choice. At the time of this writing, the owner is discussing with the City the installation of an open air café and an accompanying upgrading of the space.\n"

            "details": "With no central nervous system controlling the whole, this 50,095-square-foot plaza is distributed into seven fragments covering virtually all of the otherwise unoccupied lot area of this full-block complex bordered by Seventh Avenue, West 33rd Street, Eighth Avenue, and West 34th Street. Two notches in the north and south corners of a detached existing building on Seventh Avenue create tiny plaza areas adjacent to the public sidewalk. An open-air rectangular through-block passage connecting West 33rd and 34th Streets is located between the Seventh Avenue building and One Penn Plaza. Long and short rectangular strips of plaza flank north and south sides of One Penn Plaza, in front of the two small arcades. The largest and most usable of the plaza areas is near Eighth Avenue, between low-rise store fronts and the western side of the tower.\n\nSeveral years ago, the owner voluntarily upgraded substantial portions of this “as-of-right” plaza in anticipation of filing an application to the City for permission to close the space at night, an application that only succeeds with such upgrading. Although the application was never filed, the improvement was nonetheless completed, and the positive results are corroborated by substantially increased public use.\nElevated several steps above the sidewalk, the plaza features at its middle a unique water feature: a 10-foot-tall stone combination fountain that emits fog in summer and steam in winter. The fog is made from regular domestic cold water broken up into small particles by a fan in the basement underneath the fountain. The steam comes from a Con Edison steam line whose pressure is dramatically reduced by the time it reaches the fountain. According to the architect for the project, given the wind-tunnel problems created by the juxtaposition of One Penn Plaza, the plaza surface, and the low-rise buildings, a traditional fountain “would have splashed water all over the place.” Besides the novelty of it, however, what is especially refreshing is the implicit recognition that New York is a northern city with a substantial number of cold days, and that outdoor public spaces need to take better account of the reality of winter in their designs.\nThe rest of the plaza is strong on functionality. Semicircular stone benches surround planters at both side street entrances and, along with copious amounts of ledge seating, accommodate the large lunchtime crowds that appear to enjoy the sunny environment and the choices from the various food outlets. Landscaping, especially the trees nestled in two areas toward the west, soften the space. The low-rise buildings effectively buffer the plaza from Eighth Avenue.\nThe through-block passage nearer Seventh Avenue has also been transformed. Once an empty corridor, it now provides bench seating in three cigar-shaped configurations to satisfy lunchtime patrons who prefer the food outlets here.\n"

Mostly out of the sun’s reach, the back room is crowded by the placement of a square planter with four trees in its middle. Both areas have plentiful fixed bench seating. Further north is visual residual space filled with landscaping. A sign that used to prohibit only ball playing has been updated to include skateboarding and rollerblading. The public space plaque on the brick wall east of the entrance is obscured by shrubs.\nUsable residual space occupies the front of the building, with planters flanking both sides of the canopied entrance. The remaining visual residual space east of the building is hardly visible behind the tall wire fence.\n"

            "details": "Pockets of outdoor required pedestrian circulation space are located at both ends of this mid-block, through-block building on East 49th and 50th Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenues. Old and new city are physically juxtaposed at the 930-square-foot special permit pedestrian circulation space, where the modern Saks Tower and the venerable department store Saks Fifth Avenue with its stylized metal canopy co-exist. The space is large enough to accommodate smokers who, ostracized from building interiors, take their cigarette breaks here. Some seating and planting are required. On East 50th Street, the building entrance recess area is, as it should be, miniscule.\nThe owner is also required to allow public passage from East 49th to 50th Streets through a portion of the Saks department store men’s department. Together with Tower 49’s public access passageway linking East 48th and 49th Streets one block south, this permission to pass through establishes a two-block pathway connecting East 48th and 50th Streets. At a recent site visit, the required signs at both entrances were absent. No record of City approval for the absence has been found.\nAnother mid-block, two-block run exists between East 51st and 53rd Streets, composed of spaces at Olympic Tower and HarperCollins. Given the almost instinctive human longing to connect the dots, it is interesting to wonder what possibilities exist for installing a through-block connection on the block between Saks Tower and Olympic Tower, thereby forging a five-block chain. The answer is none. Saint Patrick’s Cathedral occupies the full block separating Saks Tower and Olympic Tower. Although the cathedral authorities may look benevolently upon persons entering their place of worship, they would hardly call it a private through-block corridor, let alone a privately owned public space.\n"

            "details": "Under provisions of the 1967 Special Theatre District zoning, this office skyscraper received a floor area bonus for a legitimate theater and a supporting cast of public spaces. Between the back of the tower and the theater is a through-block landscaped pedestrian plaza connecting West 46th and 47th Streets. The space is a rectangular passageway uncovered except for a small area underneath a black boxlike structure spanning the space from the tower to the theater. For many years, conditions here were problematic. After the City complained to the owner in 1996, the owner initiated improvements. Black metal spikes atop planter and fountain ledges vanished. Planters without plants and flowers were suddenly awash with greenery and color. The dirt-filled fountain was cleaned out, decorated with a sculpture, and turned on.\nNot surprisingly, members of the public started stopping in, as well as circulating through, the space. Users especially enjoy the sunnier side on West 46th Street, where they sit on the planter benches, but they also use the serpentine planter ledges and seating nooks flanking the three descending tiers closer to West 47th Street. The only question mark that remains is the food service. The space is required by special permit to provide a restaurant, in the black boxlike structure as it did many years ago, as well as an open air café at ground level. At a recent site visit, however, the open air café was not operating, and no record of City approval removing this requirement has been found.\nOther spaces at this building include a slim, wrap-around special permit plaza that adds space to the sidewalk, on the west side of Sixth Avenue and the two side streets, and a basement concourse, accessed from the special permit plaza near the corner of West 47th Street and Sixth Avenue and from the building lobby, that connects to the subway.\n"

            "details": "The covered pedestrian space at Trump Tower is simultaneously New York City’s most famous and least understood privately owned public space. Most famous, because everyone has heard of it. Least understood, because few New Yorkers appreciate that this space is legally required to be open and accessible to the public. The developer Donald Trump obtained zoning floor area bonuses in return for the covered pedestrian space and two outdoor landscaped terraces on upper floors, as well as for additional retail space. In short, this unabashed, unapologetic, and by any crowd measure popular celebration of commerce is a product of public, as well as private, entrepreneurial esprit.\nA sign near the entrance declares, “Welcome to the world’s most extraordinary shopping experience.” And, indeed, hyperbole is the order of the day. The interior at Trump Tower is eye candy, a confection of colors, layers, reflections, movements, and glitz. A doorman in uniform, like that of a royal guard, ushers visitors through the monumental brass-glass-façade of the Fifth Avenue entrance. Red, pink, orange, and beige-swirled marble walls and floors merge to overtake the senses. In gravity’s thrall, visitors are pulled by the corridor’s downward slope past retail stores and two large gold-colored Ts to the centerpiece, a six-story skylit shopping atrium. Physically encircled by overhanging balcony corridors, multistory water wall, and five sets of switchback escalators, the atrium strenuously engages visual and aural senses. Reflections and sounds bounce off the profusion of marble, brass, glass, and mirrored surfaces. People stream up and down the escalators, sometimes to the point of overcrowding, then peer out over shiny railings rimming the precipitous edges of the shopping floors. While many of the stores seem geared to a predominantly tourist clientele, the shopping ambiance, even if vicarious, is almost overpowering.\nThe covered pedestrian space’s legally required floor area occurs at both street and below-street concourse levels. At street level in the entrance corridor across from the elevators is the first recognizable public amenity, a long marble bench where people plant themselves, bags askew, to gain strength for further Fifth Avenue shopping or simply to relax. The bench has an interesting past. In 1984, an enthusiast of the space wrote a letter to Mr. Trump and the City’s Department of Buildings, with a copy to then Mayor Edward Koch, complaining that management had placed plants and flowers on the bench, thereby obstructing sitting. The plants and flowers were subsequently removed.\nAt concourse level at the base of the atrium are numerous movable tables and chairs tightly packed on a slightly elevated platform next to the water wall. In the past, nearby food outlets have indulged in episodes of café creep, spilling out into the covered pedestrian space. It is important to recognize that members of the public may sit at any of these tables and chairs without obligation to purchase anything. Public restrooms are located at the end of a corridor leading from the southwest corner of the space.\nThe two outdoor landscaped terraces on upper levels require a degree of perseverance to find, especially because signage on the street floor where most of the public initially gathers is meager. Reachable by one of the elevators off the Fifth Avenue entrance corridor or by escalators, the fourth floor terrace at the southeast corner of the atrium is a petite garden space with trees, planters, comfortable polished granite ledge seating, and birds-eye views of the iconic post-modern Sony building, designed by Philip Johnson to the east, and Fifth Avenue to the west. The recently renovated and more ambitious landscaped terrace on the north side of the fifth floor is currently less used than its fourth floor counterpart, an irony in that the space is not only more capacious and better appointed, but it is also more easily reached, whether by escalator, by Trump elevator off the Fifth Avenue entrance corridor, by Niketown elevator from street level near the northeast corner of the covered pedestrian space, or from the top floor of Niketown itself. Signs at and within the multiple entries unfortunately tend to confuse, referring to the Public Garden, the Roof Terrace, a location on the fifth floor, and a location on the sixth floor. In fact, the landscaped terrace is on Trump’s fifth floor and Niketown’s sixth floor.\nWhatever it is called, the space is an extremely pleasant rectangular roof garden extending to a view of East 57th Street. The street scene is visible though five huge picture windows crowned with four American flags, loosely evoking the New York impressionist paintings of Childe Hassam. A blue-tinged pool with fountains is flanked by fixed metal benches on one side and nine large trees on the other. Stylish movable silver tables and chairs are distributed throughout, and nearest East 57th Street is an elevated sliver with additional tables and chairs and a secluded corner. The only thing missing is the users.\nA passageway connects the Trump covered pedestrian space to the indoor spaces at 590 Madison Avenue to the east. Although this marriage of spaces is the City’s only example of connected indoor public spaces uninterrupted by a street, it is hardly a union of like personalities. To the benefit of both, the former’s commercial exuberance is nicely counterbalanced by the latter’s tranquillity. A third covered pedestrian space, at the Sony building across East 56th Street from 590 Madison Avenue, makes this area a high-density showcase for indoor public spaces.\n"

            "details": "Plaza renovations can cover a multitude of sins. Years ago, when this was the JC Penney building, much of the plaza in front of the tower on the west side of Sixth Avenue between West 52nd and 53rd Streets was sunk 21 steps below the sidewalk, reachable by stairwells on north and south ends. At the bottom was a narrow, rectangular pit with fixed benches, planters, and a metal fish sculpture. The space was dark, dreary, and, understandably, rarely used. Ironically, it was occasionally closed off by metal chain, as if to keep out the hordes seeking entry. The intrepid few who ventured below would be looked down upon, literally, by street-level passersby, or perhaps even forgotten entirely.\nAlthough the original 1961 Zoning Resolution permitted sunken plazas up to 12 feet below street level, few have been produced and none has proved successful. As discussed elsewhere in this book, planners have concluded that, as a general rule, active street-level pedestrian activity is a significant contributor to the economic and social health of an area, and that sunken or elevated spaces have a strong tendency to enervate such life. To thrive on their own terms, sunken spaces would have to offer activities such as food service and subway access that draw the user into, as well as through, the space. Remaining examples of sunken outdoor spaces in the city include the McGraw-Hill space several blocks south on Sixth Avenue, and the Paramount Plaza space on Broadway to the west, and the open air concourse at Citigroup Center.\nThe renovated plaza on Sixth Avenue is totally on the level, with no evidence whatsoever of the former pit. Three Jim Dine sculptures, collectively entitled Looking Toward the Avenue, present verdigris bronze renditions of Venus De Milo, at heights of 14, 18, and 23 feet, emerging from water pools at north and south corners. Planters with benches provide comfortable seating in the West 52nd and 53rd Street extensions of the plaza.\nArcade spaces are provided in long strips and short bursts along much of the side street frontages. At a recent site visit, restaurants and retail facilities operated in much of the space on West 53rd Street and some of the space on West 52nd Street. No record of City approval for such uses has been found.\n"

            "details": "The privately owned public and private spaces framing the three street sides of this brownish-red, polished granite-clad building, formerly known as the Wang building, are elegant, understated, and effective. There are no extravagant gestures here, just a compelling unity of design, materials, color, and geometry that calmly serve their apparent intention. Indeed, such unity makes it difficult, even for the trained eye, to determine, without the legally approved site plan in hand, the precise allocation of open space into urban plaza, sidewalk widening, and private property categories.\nThe spaces occupy most of the setback from the front lot lines on the west side of Third Avenue, on East 48th Street, and on East 49th Street. The sidewalk widening is adjacent and parallel to the public sidewalks along Third Avenue and East 49th Street. Because the public sidewalk and the sidewalk widening use the same granite and brick paving, however, the best visual clue for establishing the boundary line is south, where the eastern face of the Buchanan apartment building occupying the Third Avenue blockfront between East 47th and 48th Streets is built to the front lot line of that property. The northern boundary of the sidewalk widening is likewise discernible by glancing west to the nearest building facade. The southern boundary on East 48th Street matches up with the southwestern edge of 780 Third Avenue. Although installed by the building owner, the 14 trees growing out of the pavement on both Third Avenue and East 49th Street are located on the publicly owned sidewalk, and thus are designated street trees. Ironically these trees tend to undercut the value of the sidewalk widening, in that pedestrians appear to veer to the outside of these trees rather than taking full advantage of the widened space.\nThe other public space here is the L-shaped urban plaza wrapping around the building at the northwest corner of East 48th Street and Third Avenue. Five trees along the southern edge create a sense of enclosure. In the middle is a long rectangular polished granite slab, allowing seating on exterior and interior edges. Movable tables and chairs associated with the adjacent café are laid out between the granite bench and the building. The movable sign announces, “Outdoor Seating for Burke & Burke Customers Only. Thank You” and the open air café, indeed, has been approved by the City. Another granite bench built into the building wall to the west provides additional seating, next to the public space plaque and a swanky built-in litter receptacle. Another long rectangular polished granite slab and built-in wall bench are located on the East 49th Street side of the building, apparently satisfying the linear feet seating requirement attached to the urban plaza and sidewalk widening without, it seems, being located in either the urban plaza or the sidewalk widening. So where is the privately owned private space at 780 Third Avenue? It extends out from the building on much of its Third Avenue frontage and all of its East 49th Street frontage to the sidewalk widening.\n"

            "details": "The primary space of this residential plaza is on the north side of East 88th Street, slightly east of Third Avenue, at the back of its host residential tower to the north. Zoning compliance issues continue to be a problem here. In 1996, the Department of Buildings issued a notice of violation for failure to exhibit a public space plaque and to operate lighting. At several recent site visits, the gates at the entrance have been locked during required hours of access. The plaque was present, but the space was closed during the very hours stated on the plaque, and the plaque’s stated hours of access, 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., varied by one half hour from the required hours of 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. or dark, whichever is later. No record of City approval for a change of required hours or denial of access has been located.\nOther aspects of the space do not enhance its allure. Barbed wire crowns the gate and fence along the sidewalk perimeter, and garbage dumpsters used by the adjacent store occupy the public sidewalk at the western edge. Inside the gates, the space is surfaced in concrete, and surrounding building walls are covered in a jumble of materials and in some places display graffiti and peeling paint. Brick planters are sparsely landscaped. At least there is plentiful seating on comfortable wood slat benches. The service entrance at the back of the building is the only indication that this otherwise orphan space has a parent building.\nSmall pieces of usable residual space are located on east and west, but not center, areas in front of the building entrance on East 89th Street. A rectangular brick wall planter filled with pretty flowers has polished granite ledges that are sittable, at least for tall persons. A nearby sign states that this is private property and that no loitering is permitted.\n"

Several trees line its eastern side. A small, elevated platform to the west, topped with a geometric pattern of black-granite seating ledges and trees, appears almost ceremonial in its composition and placement. Toward the front of the building is a triangular arcade.\nThe East 37th Street plaza is supposed to be entered from the public sidewalk up two narrow stairwells that now present large, black metal gates at top locked at a recent site visit. No record of City approval has been found to support the installation or locking of these gates. The plaza and arcade space behind the gates, however, is pleasant, with stands of trees on east and west ends and plenty of movable café tables and chairs currently used by building tenants, as if this were the building’s private backyard.\n"

The vaulted skylight covering much of this three-story-high narrow corridor brings to mind aspects of light and airy nineteenth-century European shopping arcades. A skybridge bisects the space in the middle. The space is unenclosed at both street sides.\nAs a through block galleria, the space is designed to serve both circulation and destination goals. Thus, 14 tables and 56 movable chairs are required to be dedicated to unfettered use by the public. At a recent site visit, however, private restaurants fronting the galleria had taken apparent possession of some, if not all, of the tables and chairs. No record of City approval for this use has been found. Furthermore, as arrayed, the tables and chairs interfered with the galleria’s obligation to maintain a minimum clear path width of 15 feet. At least the fixed benches in a recessed area off the main corridor near West 53rd Street, framed at back by an impressive glass block wall, as well as several benches at north and south ends, have not yet been commercially co-opted.\nThe five other spaces in the six-block pedestrian passageway start with the through block gallerias at PaineWebber and Flatotel to the south, and the through block connection at Rihga Royal Hotel, the through block connection at CitySpire, and the through block connection at Metropolitan Tower, to the north.\n"

            "details": "Over its quarter-century life, the Olympic Tower through-block covered pedestrian space linking East 51st and 52nd Streets has faced the awesome challenge of competing for public space users with one of the world’s greatest shopping streets, Fifth Avenue. Why should anyone go to this space, when Fifth Avenue runs parallel some 50 feet to the west and the space’s existence is not even evident to the average Fifth Avenue pedestrian? If the space were to succeed as a destination, it would have to offer more than simple protection from the elements. Although it contributed to the creation of a parallel pedestrian circulation system, along with the HarperCollins through block arcade to the north, connecting East 51st to 53rd Streets, the closeness of Fifth Avenue would decrease the shortcut appeal. The space’s long-standing history of scant public use, restaurant closings, and absent retail tenants only underscores the difficulty of the competition. At a recent site visit, the space was under renovation, suggesting that its owner is still trying to discover the right design, including amenities, and other uses that would make it a success.\n\nEntered from East 51st Street across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral or from East 52nd Street across from the southern end of the HarperCollins through block arcade, the space observes the two-zone design convention of several enclosed through-block covered pedestrian spaces, dedicating part of the space to circulation and part to destination functions. Here, the western portion is dedicated to movement and access to the elevators for the commercial space in Olympic Tower. Without retail stores or seating along this western side, there is no reason to linger, stop, or change direction.\nThe eastern portion lying out of circulation’s way accommodates the functional amenities, although the proposed renovation may change this arrangement. Closest to East 51st Street is a small area that has yet to find its identity. Previously used for restaurant seating, general seating, and an adjacent newstand, it has been subject to renovation efforts several times before. Toward the middle are the restrooms and, in the past, a café. Tables and chairs arrayed on two tiers descending northward overlook a granite-backed waterfall and basement-level pool. When the waterfall is in operation, a mirror creates the illusion of more water. A vacant, glass-enclosed room at pool level, visible but inaccessible from above, is all that remains of unsuccessful restaurant efforts. Close to East 52nd Street was the only tiny retail location that had operated consistently, although it appears to be closed.\nThe presence of a parallel through-block covered pedestrian space so close to Fifth Avenue raises an interesting urban planning question. What is wrong with walking and shopping on Fifth Avenue? That the City at one time allowed, even encouraged, the creation of an alternative circulation network and off-the-street spaces that would draw pedestrians and shoppers away from retailers on Fifth Avenue may seem strange today. In the early 1970s, however, city planners were worried that the Fifth Avenue public sidewalks were becoming so crowded that the experience of shopping and promenading was being compromised. They were also concerned that passive uses such as travel agencies and bank branches were squeezing out active retail uses that made Fifth Avenue the success it was.\nTo address these issues, the City adopted in 1971 the Special Fifth Avenue District, a zoning district designed, among other things, to “preserve, protect, and enhance the character of Fifth Avenue as the showcase of New York and national retail shopping,” and to “encourage the concentration of major stores, retail clustering, restaurants and related activities which complement the special image and character of this unique area.” Mid-block parallel pathways and interior spaces, strategically deployed, were seen as devices that could alleviate some of the sidewalk congestion, for the greater good of the street. The only problem, of course, was the enormous odds against creating anything remotely providing the vitality of a real street that would in fact siphon off pedestrians. The stretch of Fifth Avenue between East 42nd and 57th Streets offers, in addition to spaces at Olympic Tower and HarperCollins, covered pedestrian spaces at 575 Fifth Avenue, 650 Fifth Avenue, and Trump Tower, an approved permanent passageway at 712 Fifth Avenue, an indoor public access passageway at Tower 49, and through block access at Saks Tower, that accept the challenge.\n"

A silver-colored abstract sculpture rises near the northeast corner of Second Avenue and East 83rd Street. Ledges have two rows of metal spikes that prevent sitting. More landscaping is adjacent to the east side of the tower. The functional public space is also east of the tower. A pathway normally used for garbage storage also leads to a gate that provides access to a play area for children on the roof above the garage entrance. The space used to have a built-in chessboard, but now has a giant, colorful children’s play set.\n.\n"

            "details": "Located at back of the Dag Hammarskjold Tower at the northwest corner of Second Avenue and East 46th Street, the primary space of this residential plaza skillfully deploys basic amenities of seating, water, landscaping, and southern orientation to attract a sizable following. Three entryways, from the west side of Second Avenue, the northwest corner of Second Avenue and East 46th Street, and the north side of East 46th Street west of Second Avenue, cut through the sidewalk perimeter of planters filled with trees and shrubs. A fourth entryway, from East 47th Street west of Second Avenue, snakes around and under the western edge of the tower as a required “public access passageway” through non-bonused public open space mandated by special permit. At a recent site visit, this passageway was closed during a time period when it was obligated to be open. No record of City approval for such closure has been found.\n\nAll four entryways converge south of the building on an octagon-shaped space with mirror-image octagon-shaped fountain and pool anchoring the center. Seating is plentiful. Wooden benches and sittable ledges face the fountain and line the entryways. With food available at nearby food market salad bars, lunchtimes here, especially during the summer, are jammed. The space draws a diverse group of users, including office workers, caregivers with children, and less fortunate New Yorkers. Significantly, the plentiful seating and variety of seating areas permit the different user groups to stake out their areas without impinging on the needs and desires of others.\nAdditional residential plaza surrounds the building on the south side of East 47th Street and the west side of Second Avenue. In front of the lobby entrance at the southeast corner of the two streets is a fountain and, nearby, a bust, by Carina Ari, of the diplomat and Nobel Prize winner after whom the tower is named.\n"

            "details": "This three-level covered pedestrian space may be entered from the east side of Third Avenue between East 49th and 50th Streets or from the south side of East 50th Street, roughly 150 feet east of Third Avenue. The avenue entrance heralds itself with overhanging white lattice and the Crystal Pavilion nameplate. If the idea of a crystal pavilion stimulates expectations of a fully skylit, glass-enclosed indoor space, then the reality of a darker interior enclosed principally by opaque surfaces but for a brief run of glass at the eastern side will disappoint. If the crystal allusion is meant to convey, however, the interior’s multiple sources of illumination and their rebounding off the numerous reflective surfaces, then the space will be found truer to its moniker.\nThe covered pedestrian space identifies its three public levels as terrace, pavilion, and atrium. These labels may be confusing, however, and the space is better understood as having street, concourse (lower), and mezzanine (second) floor levels. The street level is a wide, right-angled circulation corridor, connecting Third Avenue and East 50th Street entrances, and providing access to the other two levels. The concourse level, reached by escalator near the Third Avenue entrance, by freestanding elevator at the midpoint of the street-level corridor, or down 18 steps from the East 50th Street portal, supplies the most usable floor area, the majority of amenities, and the best vantage point for appreciating the space’s volume and design. The mezzanine level may be reached by elevator or via dramatic escalator into the sky seen through the glass wall and ceiling to the east.\nWhen shafts of sunlight pass through the glass and reach the deepest levels, the interior does indeed come alive. Mostly, however, the job of illumination is assumed by a theatrical panoply of single spots and snaking fluorescent tubes hugging the underbellies of escalators and upper levels. Lightbulbs go on as the elevator cab rises, suggesting the carnival diversion in which individuals test their strength by slamming an oversized hammer onto a platform in order to propel an object to ring the bell. Stainless steel-colored columns rise past bands of horizontal corridor railings. Polished granite walls add more reflective surfaces.\nThe concourse level of the covered pedestrian space is organized into three “neighborhoods” of movable tables and chairs that are well utilized during lunch hour. One area is set up under the full-height ceiling at center, between the elevator and a small stage to the west that accommodates a piano. Several planters with palm fronds and sittable ledges are nearby, as are a waterfall and meandering riverlike pool. More clusters of tables and chairs are laid out along a corridor beneath the street-level corridor, in front of three cafés along the southern edge. A third collection of tables and chairs with adjacent café is hidden east of the elevator, within an intimate atrium of richly patterned marble floor and glass ceiling three stories above. It is here, next to another waterfall, that the aspiration of a crystal pavilion comes closest to realization. At a recent site visit, however, none of the water features was operational, although they are required to function while the space is open. Public restrooms are located under the stairs at the northeast portion of the concourse level. The mezzanine level rings the space, with several granite benches at its southern end. Here are additional points of observation for taking in the space below.\n"

Unlike legally defined through block connection spaces that are effectively required to be provided by the developer to satisfy its pedestrian circulation space requirements without a zoning bonus, and are expressly designed to serve the singular purpose of circulation, through block gallerias are provided in exchange for a floor area bonus and have supplemental callings, including, for example, the furnishing of public seating.\nAt recent site visits, the space has fallen short on both callings. The seating provided, including a wooden bench near the West 52nd Street entrance, appears to be less than the 185.75 linear feet required. During the specified hours of access, the gates were locked. No record of City approval for these variations has been found. At least the eastern wall is leavened with several small recessed areas filled with shrubs.\nThe five other spaces in the six-block alternative pedestrian network include the through block galleria at PaineWebber to the south, and the through block galleria at 1325 Avenue of the Americas, the through block connection at Rihga Royal Hotel, the through block connection at CitySpire, and the through block connection at Metropolitan Tower.\n"

            "details": "Three of the four public spaces at 55 Broadway were mandated by the recently repealed Special Greenwich Street Development District, a special purpose zoning district enacted in 1971 to implement an ambitious plan for pedestrian improvements within a 24-block area of lower Manhattan bounded by Broadway to the east, the World Trade Center complex to the north, Battery Park City to the west, and Battery Park to the south. Unlike traditional zoning districts that declare general rules applying uniformly to all lots within the district, the Special Greenwich Street district mapped specific, unique, mandatory and elective pedestrian circulation and lot improvements block-by-block, requiring or encouraging future developments on such blocks to provide such features. The final result was to be an innovative, multi-level pedestrian circulation system facilitating movement, shopping, subway access, and enjoyment of open space in the face of an increasingly dense downtown.\n\nThe greatest danger to this type of zoning is that the real estate market will not cooperate, that development will not occur as expected, and that the plan thus will be implemented in a piecemeal fashion that fails to accomplish its overall goals. Such was the fate of the Special Greenwich Street Development District zoning plan. For the lot now occupied by 55 Broadway, for example, the Special Greenwich Street plan required an “enclosed pedestrian bridge” spanning Trinity Place east-to-west, an “elevated shopping way” some 22 feet above and parallel to Trinity Place, a “pedestrian connection” from that “elevated shopping way” to Broadway paralleling Exchange Alley, and an “arcade” along Broadway. When private development on the other side of Trinity Place did not occur as anticipated, the zoning requirement for the “enclosed pedestrian bridge” was dropped before the bridge was ever constructed.\nThe four legal types of public space that do exist at 55 Broadway were provided to some degree on the assumption that an upper-level pedestrian network would be constructed. Together, the four spaces forge a pathway between Broadway and Trinity Place that duplicates the downward-sloping Exchange Alley immediately adjacent to the north. Beginning next to the intersection of Broadway and Exchange Alley, the narrow urban plaza squeezes pedestrians between the steps leading from the Alley and the arcade under the piano-shaped building edge to the south. Further west, four round tree-filled planters on one side and banded arcade columns on the other flank a chutelike corridor of increasingly narrow width. The covered loggia supplies escalators to navigate the substantial grade change down to the lower-level retail shopping arcade, beyond which is Trinity Place. Without the enclosed pedestrian bridge, however, the loggia now would have no reason to connect pedestrians to an upper-level “elevated shopping way” directly above the existing lower-level shopping arcade along Trinity Place that were together known as a “shopping way” and had been required by the Special Greenwich Street Development District zoning. Thus, like the bridge, the elevated shopping way component of the shopping way was dropped by the City in 1992. That effectively ended the hopes for an upper-level network that would also connect to 45 Broadway’s similarly mapped, but similarly never implemented, elevated shopping way along Trinity Place to the south.\nBy comparison, another Special Greenwich Street Development District pedestrian improvement amenity suffered an unhappier fate. A mandatory “open pedestrian bridge” spanning Greenwich Street between One Bankers Trust Plaza and a City-owned low-rise building was actually constructed. Unfortunately, contrary to expectations, the existing low-rise building that housed a City fire station and a fast food restaurant was never replaced by the anticipated new office tower that would justify the bridge. After years of carrying no meaningful foot traffic, the bridge was recently demolished.\nEven without the upper-level network, three reasons explain why a pedestrian might choose the 55 Broadway pathway over the adjacent Exchange Alley. First, much of it is covered. Second, it is level for much of its run, and allows escalators rather than the slope of Exchange Alley to facilitate the descent or ascent. Third, planter ledges and a movable seating unit that was missing at a recent site visit furnish seating for the momentary stops that pedestrians like to make. A recent site visit also revealed café tables and chairs arrayed in the shopping arcade along Trinity Place. No record of City approval for this use has been found.\n"

A comparison between plazas produced under the 1961 Zoning Resolution’s lenient “as-of-right” plaza definition, such as this plaza, and plazas produced under zoning’s more demanding 1977 residential plaza standards, is easily made by peering over the wall to the east. There, one floor below, is the residential plaza belonging to River Tower.\nThe remaining plaza space here is a sunny, elevated shelf several steps above the sidewalk that wraps around the building at the southeast corner of First Avenue and East 54th Street.

            "details": "Located on a lot bounded by the south side of Pearl Street and the east side of State Street, the array of privately owned public spaces at 17 State Street — urban plaza, sidewalk widening, arcade, and public exhibit space — is a marvelous illustration of the diversity within the City’s public space inventory. Two of the four spaces are fully outdoors, one is covered but otherwise open to the air, and the fourth is fully indoors. Two have required amenities, the others do not. Two were approved “as-of-right” by the Department of Buildings and received zoning bonuses, one was certified by the Chairperson of the City Planning Commission and received a zoning bonus, the fourth was a condition of a special permit issued by the Board of Standards and Appeals and was not bonused. In short, by examining these spaces, much can be learned about the City’s program for privately owned public space.\n\nOld and new are juxtaposed here. Sandwiched between the silvery metallic tower to the west and the similarly clad one-story shed to the east is the main portion of urban plaza. Its swirling rough cobblestone paving and rows of antique park-style fixed wood benches want to evoke the historical city, even as the office building, like a small version of Citigroup Center, is poised for takeoff on its multiple piers. A bust of author Herman Melville, who was born at this site, sits in a plexiglass-covered perch entombed within the one-story shed. The romance of the park bench is interrupted by the metal rail dividers, intended to make slouching difficult and horizontal sleeping impossible, a reminder of pressing present-day social issues. An unusually tall, capacious arcade occupies much of the tower’s underbelly, encircling the X-beamed, glass-enclosed lobby core that blocks views from the urban plaza west across State Street and Battery Park to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty in the distance. Outside stairs in the arcade next to Pearl Street go somewhere, but it is impossible to tell exactly where from the vantage point of the arcade or the adjacent sidewalk widening.\nHistory is literally on display inside the shed to the east, where a public exhibit space called “New York Unearthed,” open Monday through Friday, 12:00 noon to 6:00 p.m., serves as the South Street Seaport Museum’s off-site urban archaeology museum. A “six-pounder,” a cannon dumped into the East River before 1789 and recovered from its bottom, pointedly welcomes the user at the entrance. Pairing archaeological objects with dioramas, the glass-enclosed displays in this tiny climate-controlled room offer slices of New York’s history over 6,000 years, covering the city’s role as a hunting ground for Native Americans, as a Dutch and English trading post, as an immigrant city filled with tenements, and as home to one of the first free-black communities.\nPast the guard and down a long staircase is the basement level, where professional archaeologists are visibly at work in a conservation laboratory, happy to talk with visitors about the museum’s collection of artifacts. On the wall is a section model showing what lies underneath present-day streets and buildings including, for example, a privy from the 1810s and old walls. There is also a modern operational restroom toward the back. A room normally featuring a projection show was closed at a recent site visit as the museum searches for $12,000 for a new projector. Those intrigued by seeing more of what lies underneath the city’s streets and lots may venture several blocks east to the Goldman Sachs building at 85 Broad Street, where ground-level plexiglass hatches in the public space reveal archaeological objects discovered during the construction of that tower.\nHow did 17 State Street’s public exhibit space become a required privately owned public space? When the developer of the building sought a special permit in 1986 from the Board of Standards and Appeal to modify the height and setback zoning regulations as applied to its building, one of the Board’s conditions was that the developer agree to provide this space. Museums or satellite branches may be found at several other public spaces, including the Museum of American Folk Art in the covered plaza at Two Lincoln Square, a branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art at the Philip Morris covered pedestrian space, and the Newseum at the covered pedestrian space of 590 Madison Avenue.\n"

            "details": "This indoor through block connection is the first, and by far the most opulent, passageway in a four-block network of privately owned public spaces linking West 44th to 48th Streets between Sixth Avenue and Broadway or Seventh Avenue. Integrating itself thoroughly with the hotel use, the space accrues the advantages and ambiguities of serving private, as well as public, interests. The entrance to the hotel and public space on West 44th Street is richly trimmed, with flanking silver torch sconces and a theatrically lit canopy. Inside, the through-block interior is effectively a double-loaded corridor for hotel uses, starting with a small waiting area to the west, a theater to the east, concierge and hotel check-in desk further north, elevators and stairs mid-block, and a gift shop closer to West 45th Street. The corridor wall displays large oil paintings by Carlo Maria Mariani, called Day-Night, depicting a man awake and a woman asleep. Wood panelling, polished marble and granite floors, and mirrored surfaces complete the message of luxury. In fact, the only elements that speak to public circulation, rather than hotel, uses are the silver clock dials and street identifications at both ends.\nThe positive side of this private-public merger is that there is no stinting on quality, no second-class treatment of public space. The public user enjoys the same physical environment accorded the hotel guest. The negative side is that the very identity of the space as public disappears. Like the western leg of the through block arcade at Le Parker Meridien Hotel, another hotel lobby-public space combination, it becomes difficult for even the public space expert to know that there is a public space here. When required public space entry plaques are missing, as they were at a recent site visit, then the space becomes fully privatized since members of the public cannot possibly know their rights to use this corridor.\nThe other three, more modest, spaces in this four-block network include Bertelsmann’s through block connection from West 45th to 46th Streets, United States Trust’s through block connection from West 46th to 47th Streets, and 1211 Sixth Avenue’s through block arcade from West 47th to 48th Streets. The latter two spaces are substantially east of the first two spaces, enough to discourage some pedestrians from taking advantage of the full four-block passage. Although the network is momentarily halted north of West 48th Street, it is not for lack of zoning ambition. Enacted in 1982, the Special Midtown District zoning mapped a wide geographic corridor running from West 40th to West 57th Street, 100 feet west of Sixth Avenue and 100 feet east of Broadway or Seventh Avenue, that required or strongly encouraged, usually under so-called pedestrian circulation space standards, through block connections for new developments with frontages on two east-west streets.\nUnder that zoning, the City has come remarkably close to obtaining a 13-block-long passageway. There is an outdoor through-block space at the back of the McGraw-Hill building between West 48th and 49th Streets, but it is, legally speaking, not required to be open and accessible to the public. Between West 49th and 50th Streets is another outdoor through-block space, at the back of 1251 Sixth Avenue that, at the moment, is similarly not required to be open to the public, but will become so if the proposed office building at 745 Seventh Avenue is constructed. Although there is neither a privately owned public, nor a privately owned private, mid-block space connecting West 50th and 51st Streets, the rest of the way, from West 51st to 57th Streets, is secured with one or more privately owned public spaces for each leg of that journey. The starting space is the through block galleria at the PaineWebber building.\n"

            "details": "This pleasant, sunny public open space, at the back of the residential building on the north side of West 59th Street slightly west of Amsterdam Avenue, successfully combines active children’s and passive adult recreation space. Removed from the street by its elevation up eight steps and past a gate that was deceptively closed, but not locked, at a recent site visit, the rectangular area is something of a refuge for adults and children alike. The portion closest to the entrance is for adults, with its small lawn, wood benches, trees, and perimeter planters. Moving west is an attraction for both children and adults, a ground-level, blue-colored fountain that is so approachable that it is taken over by children. Further west, the space finally gives in fully to children, with a two-tower play unit fixed on artificial turf. An elevated terrace with bench to the south and additional benches to the west supply ideal vantage points for watchful parents and caregivers.\nSmall spaces like this one are enormously valuable to a neighborhood. Elevated and fenced, yet not too remote to engender any sense of isolation, parents and caregivers can give their charges a degree of freedom that makes both child and adult happy. This public open space and the one at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center, visible to the southeast across Tenth Avenue, were required at the same time by related City Planning Commission special permits\n"

            "details": "Mandated and bonused by the now repealed Special Greenwich Street Development District, New York City’s most ambitious outdoor and indoor two-level privately owned public space network is located around and in this building occupying the full block bounded by Liberty, Greenwich, Albany, and Washington Streets. Between Liberty Street and the north face of the building are its prin­cipal public gathering spaces, a substantial arcade at street level and a larger elevated plaza one level up that covers the arcade as well as a one-story building bump-out. The arcade is interrupted by a large dish of water overflowing into a semicircular pool, surrounded by a ledge for sining. A circular cut-out above the water fountain into the floor of the elevated plaza allows a shaft of sunlight to peek through and brighten the otherwise dark arcade. In previ­ous years, vendors selling plants and fruits, candies, sun­glasses, and other sundries have been located near here.\nAccess to the elevated plaza is principally by stairwell next to the water feature. One emerges with striking, unob­structed views of the World Trade Center towers to the north, but anticipated views of the Hudson River to the west are now blocked by the Battery Park City complex. Seating is ample, with four fixed tree-filled square planters surrounded by benches and six stools encircling six fixed circular tables to the west, and six stools surrounding five stone tables to the east. Two kiosks are required, and a food kiosk has been open during the summer when the elevat­ed plaza enjoys most of its use. In 1999, the owners obtained an authori­zation from the City Planning Commis­sion to improve the elevated plaza, by installing a glass­roofed 12-foot wide trellislike structure, replacing existing fixed seats with indi­vidual contour seats with arms, adding 13 individual plant­ers along the plaza’s northern edge and two large planting beds, and providing 20 pole-mounted and 6 building-mounted lighting fixtures.\n"

            "details": "Public spaces and their surrounding neighborhoods are inevitably interdependent. Sometimes a public space can help define a neighborhood; sometimes a neighborhood overwhelms a public space. This half-acre, slightly elevated rectangular plaza at the southeast corner of Sixth Avenue and West 43rd Street dramatically illustrates the interdependency.\n\nAlthough Bryant Park, the City-owned park one block south, is a stunning success, and nearby Times Square is a sizzling commercial address, it was not long ago that the two were havens of drug dealing and related street crime. Spillover of these activities to large privately owned public spaces at such buildings as Grace and Bell Atlantic was hard to fight. In 1985, 21 persons were arrested and many more made to line up, hands on planters or against the Grace building wall, in a police raid on drug use and sales in the space. An audit of the bottoms of planters at the Grace plaza in the late 1980s would yield dozens of empty multicolored crack vials in the dirt as continuing evidence of a losing battle.\nIt must first be observed that the initial design of the space hardly encouraged general public use. Produced under the lenient “as-of-right” standards of an earlier zoning era, the space was characterized by a vast emptiness wrapped in expensive marble tiles, a sun-deprived northern orientation, and a paucity of functional amenities that discouraged the broad public use that is the necessary, if not sufficient, condition for combating problematic users. The arcade space on West 43rd and 42nd Streets contributed little to the mix.\nStill, the owner did employ management and design initiatives to fight the criminal takeover. It hired private security guards and off-duty police officers to patrol the space, with little success. One guard recounted, “You can get killed if you don’t know how to deal with [the dealers]. Don’t let them get to know you, don’t get friendly with them.” In 1981, the owner erected a spiked six-foot-high iron fence along the public sidewalk perimeters, claiming publicly that construction and demolition issues related to an adjacent building required that the public for its own safety be excluded from the space. As the fence lingered, however, it became evident that the owner had something else in mind than construction-related safety issues, and the City forced it to remove the fence.\nThe owner also developed a number of plans to renovate the space. One plan included a two-story retail arcade, another involved a food kiosk, water feature, and other amenities associated with urban plazas that would be provided in return for permission from the City to close the space at night. Unfortunately, a dispute on final terms for the nighttime closing doomed this plan.\nOne may wonder whether the plaza at Grace could have ever turned the tide on its own. After all, it took a bold mixture of out-of-the-box thinking, significant investments of public and private money, and invention of innovative public-private development and management vehicles to reinvigorate Bryant Park and Times Square. Today, the plaza here stands more or less as it was originally conceived and constructed. A double row of tree planters occupies the northeast corner. A stretch of benches along the northern edge and one long marble bench along the southern wall provide seating hardly conducive to socializing in that they make face-to-face contact difficult. A small utility building is found in the center. With the sea change in the neighborhood’s environment, the time is ripe for imagining once more a renewed Grace plaza.\n"

Completed in 1972, this plaza and arcade have for many years left open a window on the pop art and psychedelic color sensibilities of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The purchase of the building by a new owner and its conversion from office to residential dormitory use for a university has recently eliminated some of those elements, but many still remain.\nReminiscent of the large, wall-mounted chessboard at another Kaufman public space, at 767 Third Avenue, what is apparently an oversized digital clock on the wall near the corner of Water and John Streets takes time to understand. It is sufficiently complicated that a New York Times caption to a photograph of it once described it as a calendar. Nearby are yellow, blue, and red fixed metal chairs, and a phone booth sculpted in the form of a human being with facial profile and hand holding a coin.\nArt has been well-represented here. Homage to Lewis Carroll (1971), by Mary Lomprey, featured life-size, chess-like plastic pieces with faces on them painted yellow, blue, and orange. Although the scrap-metal motorcycle sculpture and the neon and corrugated steel entry tube near John and Waters Streets have been removed, the plaza and arcade space adjacent to Fulton Street to the northeast maintains the 1970s whimsy. A giant fishing lure hangs above a pool of water, its cascading hooks ready to ensnare the next victim. Entitled Very Large Fish Lure, the sculpture is credited to the Rebel Fishing Lure Co., with concept design by Rudolph de Harak, a Kaufman favorite used at other buildings. A nearby impression on the arcade wall, entitled Merman’s Mermaid (1971), by Forrest Wilson, continues the water-based theme. The rectangular water pool has six jets, viewed from above on the adult jungle gym and its multiple levels of seating. On-grade fixed chairs are plentiful in the remainder of the plaza space.\nThe Kaufman organization has always had an ambitious, personalized aesthetic for its spaces. None of the amenities was required, and the developer could just as easily have provided an empty, concrete surface and received the same amount of bonus floor area. Instead, it conceived and implemented a vision and installed a plaque to credit those who helped make it a reality. The Kaufman approach to public spaces can be further explored, downtown at 77 Water Street, and midtown at 747 Third Avenue and 767 Third Avenue.\nAt a recent site visit, the plaza triangle at the intersection of John and Pearl Streets was occupied by an open air café and café tables and chairs. No record of City approval for this use has been found.\n"

            "details": "With three separately situated, but networked, spaces in the immediate neighborhood of the Regent, it is not easy to decipher which spaces are part of the Regent’s residential plaza and which belong to the neighboring Beaumont to the east. Brick paving patterns offer the first significant clue. Although the Regent’s residential plaza is geographically split into two unconnected pieces, one located at the southeast corner of Columbus Avenue and West 61st Street, the other on the north side of West 60th Street east of Columbus Avenue, they bear a striking resemblance in design, in beige-colored brick surface material, and landscape treatment. The third space, with its purplish brick, is a residential plaza attached to the Beaumont and connects the two Regent spaces by providing access north and south.\nEnclosed by metal fence, gates, trees, and brick wall, the northern portion of the residential plaza is accessible through five entrances, three from Columbus Avenue and two from a sloped walkway parallel to a garage driveway entered from West 61st Street. The gates at all entrances should never be closed or locked, and several City enforcement actions have been mounted in past years to assure that the plaza remains open at all times. Wooden benches and brick ledges provide plentiful seating possibilities among the numerous somewhat overgrown trees and bushes. The dark atmosphere is fortunately dissipated by the light and warmth brought by afternoon sun.\nThe southern portion of residential plaza may be entered under a trellis from West 60th Street or from West 61st Street via the Beaumont residential plaza. More beige brick, wooden benches, and planting patterns confirm the family resemblance and generate a similar, muted environment. At least flowers vary the color palette. A small, elevated rectangular area deeper in the space provides privacy from the street. Among the regular space users are several retired individuals who like to feed the squirrels.\n"

            "details": "When the City Planning Commission introduced new zoning rules for plazas at residential buildings in 1977 that made southern exposures the location of first priority, it could have been thinking presciently about the development of this zoning lot. The lot runs through-block between Duane and Thomas Streets, west of Broadway, and, under the original 1961 zoning plaza standards, a plaza could have been situated at the northern front on Thomas Street. In that case, much of the space would have been in the shade, with usage seriously diminished. Instead, while the Thomas Street side has a strip of visual residual space, the primary space of this residential plaza luxuriates in sunlight for much of the day along Duane Street.\nIndeed, if there is such a thing as too much sun, this space has it. With its abundant brick surfaces both absorbing and reflecting the sun’s rays, liquid refreshment and sunglasses become a necessity during cloudless summer days. The plentiful ledge seating and fixed metal chairs certainly accommodate neighborhood users of the space, although it would be even better if it were possible to move seating to the few spots where shade is available. While the landscaping arrayed on cascading terraces at back is pleasant to look at, it would be enjoyed even more were it liberally sprinkled throughout.\nAs downtown Manhattan’s only residential plaza, the space naturally exudes a different character than spaces at office towers. Its design unabashedly embraces the virtues of intimacy and smallness, yet never turns its back on the street or its host building. The plaza edge along Duane Street is skillfully rendered, partly shielded by fixed planters and partly open for easy entrance and exit. Although some plazas are better served by isolating much or all of themselves from the surrounding area, this one correctly recognizes the salutary aspects of permeability at this location. Duane Street offers interesting views, especially of a fire station directly across the street with its colorful trucks and firefighters. A food shop is ready to supply sandwiches for the lunchtime crowd.\nThe glass-canopied entrance pathway to the tower’s front door is off to the side, nearer Broadway, but it never shuns the plaza, providing an opening near the lobby door frequently used by tower residents as they head west. Residents and outside members of the public are thus in regular contact, at least in passing. Put simply, this is one of the best examples of a neighborhood space in downtown Manhattan.\n"

            "details": "Public spaces with prominent artworks frequently become identified in the public’s mind as “the space with the such-and-such sculpture.” That is true at this park on the south side of East 54th Street east of Second Avenue, where the signature element is a tall, red, welded steel sculpture located immediately inside the entrance. Easily misidentified as a Calder, the work is by artist Alexander Liberman. Entitled Accord (1979), its five discrete metal elements, including a steel ring at the base and four straight or curving vertical pieces, seek agreement among their various geometries.\nThe square park is actually a mid-block, through-block space that extends a small fingerlike corridor south to East 53rd Street. A short V-shaped planter forces entrants from East 54th Street to veer, pinball-like, left or right of the sculpture. The expanse of brick-paved surface is surrounded on three of four sides by angled planters holding trees and ground cover, and lined with sittable ledges. In the middle of the space are facing V-shaped planters that together fashion a small interior room furnished with two benches. Several additional benches are scattered about, including one located on a snippet of elevated terrace five steps above the park floor to the east. Sufficiently detached from the noise of the street, this alcove was discovered years ago by students from a nearby theater who would come here to exercise vocally. Although the primary entrance to the residential tower is not in the space, a rapport between building and park is nonetheless established by the presence of a protruding transparent glass window off the building lobby.\nThe term “park” is not found in the standard definitions of public spaces set forth in the Zoning Resolution; instead, this space was uniquely required and christened by a variance granted by the City’s Board of Standards and Appeals. There is, however, a plaza here that was produced under the “as-of-right” plaza provisions of the 1961 Zoning Resolution, and it is easily distinguishable from the complexity and functionality of the park. Wrapping around the southeast corner of Second Avenue and East 54th Street, the plaza is extra sidewalk on Second Avenue and a semicircular drop-off driveway and pedestrian entrance for the building’s main entrance.\n"

The full-block arcade may be understood as part of a one-and-a-half block arcade circulation network that includes 110 Wall Street to the southeast. Although not part of the public space, the lobby of 100 Wall Street features a sculpture by Harold Castor that depicts historical episodes and buildings, including General Washington’s entrance into New York City, and Trinity Church. The nonstreet side of the building to the northeast includes more plaza space that merges indistinguishably into the pleasant special permit plaza belonging to 88 Pine Street.\n"

            "details": "The public space that encircles this full-block development on Greenwich, North Moore, West, and Hubert Street sides is actually composed of two different legal and physical types of plaza. In 1984, the City transferred City-owned land on this zoning lot to a private developer under the terms of the Washington Street Urban Renewal Plan, as amended. One of the Plan’s conditions required an approximately 23,000-square-foot public plaza, to be constructed to the standards of the Zoning Resolution’s urban plaza. The resulting space occupies the area in front of the building entrance on Greenwich Street, heralded near the sidewalk by an upright, oversized, red metal umbrella. This obstruction, requiring legal approval from the City before its installation, is certainly eye-catching, but should not be confused with art. This is not Andy Warhol squeezing irony from an oversized Campbell’s Soup Can, nor is it Claes Oldenburg playing with representation by way of an outsized eraser. The umbrella is the trademark of, and advertisement for, the Travelers Group, a major tenant in the building. The building itself becomes an advertisement at night, with a giant illuminated umbrella symbol attached to its north curtain wall visible from many blocks away.\nAn open walkway bisects the space, flanked by two colonnades constructed of granite-based columns, entwined vines, verdigris metal roof, glass, and wood. The initial portions of the colonnades are topped with glass roofs, but the remainders appear to be covered only by wood lattice ineffectual against rain and snow. Nonetheless, the ceremonial design of the colonnades persuades many people to walk within them to the lobby entrance, rather than choosing the wide open path between the colonnades. At north and south ends of the public plaza are large outdoor rooms surfaced with a mixture of grass and pavers and enlivened by many trees. These spaces are heavily utilized during the summer, especially during lunch hours.\nFurther west on North Moore Street is plaza space, including a narrow, usable area elevated above the sidewalk, with fixed metal tables and chairs, lots of ledges, wood benches, and huge amounts of sun. Although the very existence of amenities would suggest that the space must be legally part of the public plaza, with amenity standards far outstripping the minimal requirements for “as-of-right” plazas, it is not. However, its amenities are required by the various legal actions that created the public plaza. As one moves further west and north around the building, however, the lenient standards of “as-of-right” plazas slowly produce their customary outcome. The southern half along West Street is an open grass lawn, with some trees and great views of the Hudson River made vivid by the wind sweeping in off the water. The remaining plaza spaces along West Street, Hubert Street, and the northern half of Greenwich Street are empty concrete strips with no apparent use.\n"

Located at the southwest corner of Third Avenue and East 95th Street, the primary space relies heavily on concrete or concretelike materials for floor, planter wall, and planter ledge surfaces, materials that demand maintenance and repair over time as evidenced by the current conditions here. The landscape of small bushes and occasional trees is sparse and would benefit greatly from an undercoating of groundcover. At a recent site visit, planter ledges were mostly trimmed with metal spikes, metal trash dumpsters blocked one of the entries to the space on East 95th Street, the wall artwork was not apparent, and the bicycle rack, drinking fountain, and plaque were missing. No record of City approval for such lapses has been found. The Third Avenue usable residual space is extra sidewalk with several planters and spiked ledges.\n"

            "details": "This vest pocket park waits to be discovered, located past the augmented sidewalk some 100 feet east of Third Avenue on the south side of East 44th Street. Unlike most privately owned public spaces in the city, this one never received a zoning floor area bonus in exchange for its construction. Its provision instead was made a condition of a variance, granted by the City’s Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA), that allowed the owner to construct a larger building with more floor area, more lot coverage, and a different shape than otherwise authorized by the applicable zoning.\nTo some, this may sound like a lawyer’s technical distinction without a dime’s worth of functional difference. After all, the owner did secure the right to develop extra rentable floor area, so who cares whether that right was labeled a “floor area bonus” or whether it was authorized by the BSA. The distinction makes a difference, however, because the standards governing the design and operation of this space emanate not from any definition of public space set forth in the Zoning Resolution, but from the specific text of the BSA variance and the plans submitted by the owner to describe the proposed development under the variance. At the time the owner sought the variance, it may have proffered the park in the belief that this might facilitate BSA approval of a building that, in some respects, would not be following the underlying zoning.\nThe park is a narrow, slightly sunken, rectangle extending deeply into the lot at the back of the building. The first level is three steps down, past flanking trees. Here, muddy brown, backless benches line the eastern wall and protrude outward toward more backless benches in the middle. The green of the trees moderates the overwhelming brownish-gray wash of the brick walls. At the lower level three steps down to the west are movable white-mesh tables and chairs that were, at a recent site visit, used by the adjacent restaurant. Under the terms of the variance, the owner is required to construct a food service facility in the vest pocket park and use reasonable efforts to find a tenant to operate the facility. However, a 1974 letter from the owner’s representative to Community Board 6, the neighborhood advisory group, promised that “[a]ny restaurant facing the park shall have no right to any of the park area for outdoor dining.” Thus, it would appear that such restaurant operation in the space would contradict the 1974 letter.\n"

            "details": "Required along with a legitimate Broadway theater in return for a floor area bonus granted by a City special permit in 1973, this constellation of privately owned public spaces west of Broadway between West 45th and 46th Streets provides outdoor, covered, and indoor experiences for circulation and destination activities. Along the full Broadway frontage is Broadway Plaza, a sliver of open space that normally would be overlooked but for the fact that Times Square is now so packed with crowds that even the slightest widening of sidewalk becomes appreciated by the passing pedestrian. Two arcades leading from the plaza underneath the theater toward the interior hotel entry constitute the outdoor portion of covered public pedestrian area. Further west across the legally private through-block driveway is the indoor portion of covered public pedestrian area, on the ground floor of the hotel core, entered either from the driveway or from two doorways off Shubert Alley Extension toward the back of the building.\n\nAppropriately named, the Shubert Alley Extension is a through block arcade that “extends” One Astor Place’s Shubert Alley, one block south, to fashion a two-block, mid-block passageway from West 44th to 46th Streets. Hugging the western wall is a black metal tube, laid horizontally and vaguely sittable, and a long mirror that fosters a theatrical air. To the east is the indoor covered public pedestrian area with escalators and elevators taking the public space user, as well as hotel guests, to interior spaces on upper levels. The original 1973 special permit and approved plans called for two publicly accessible atrium spaces: a seven-floor retail shopping space rising from floors two through nine, and another atrium for the hotel starting on the twelfth floor and rising another 37 stories to a skylit top. As built years later, the structure diverges from these plans. The planned retail atrium does not exist, filled instead with meeting rooms and theater offices on floors three through seven, accessible by escalators (floor two is not accessible). Floor eight features the hotel lobby at the base of an impressive atrium, surrounded above by hotel rooms, that is the signature design of Atlanta-based architect/developer John Portman. It remains unclear where, in addition to the hotel lobby, the rest of the 40,300 square feet of interior spaces required by the special permit is located.\nAs with other public spaces that combine hotel and public uses, such as the west leg of Le Parker Meridien Hotel’s through block arcade and Millennium Broadway’s through block connection nearby, it becomes impossible to distinguish between private and public activities.\nDevelopment of the Marriott Marquis was accompanied by its own drama. To make way for the hotel, three old theaters, the Helen Hayes, the Morosco, and the Bijou, were demolished. On the morning scheduled for demolition, some 1,000 demonstrators gathered to protest the loss of these historic theaters. By prior arrangement with police, roughly 170 demonstrators, including such theater luminaries as Colleen Dewhurst, Joseph Papp, Susan Sarandon, and Michael Moriarty, were arrested for trespassing and taken away in 13 police vans. With the lifting of a temporary stay that had been previously issued by a court, the work crews went about their task of razing the theaters.\n"

            "details": "In exchange for City Planning Commission authorization to close this residential plaza at night, the owner recently completed a renovation of the space, and the results are highly promising for the neighborhood. The plaza wraps around the building’s street frontage at the southeast corner of East 93 rd Street and Second Avenue. An open, pergola-like structure, consisting of four triangular columns that support a metal lattice box over glass block floor, continues to mark the corner and serve as modest icon for the space. From Second Avenue, the wide entrance, low see-through metal fence, and consistency of grade level into the primary space east attract passersby and are a model for visual and physical permeability.\n\nAt the same time, the primary space has not sacrificed its identity as a separate area, defined at its perimeter by well-landscaped planters with polished granite seating ledges and a ground-level round planting bed anchoring the middle of the decorative paving scheme. Three German-made, high-tech steel chair units with multiple seats each are arrayed on three of the four sides, facing each other as if in conversation. Trees planted against the building at the southern edge of the space mask the building wall.\nThe provision of usable, rather than visual, residual residential plaza for the entrance corridor is welcome. Unlike visual residual space, which legally does not have to be open and accessible to the public, usable residual space must be accessible and provide functional amenities. The entrance corridor provides another steel chair seating unit and more granite ledge seating. A water sculpture near the front door will be operational in the near future. The glass bump-out from the lobby provides a perch from which the doorman can watch over both the primary and usable residual portions of the space from the inside. As of this writing, the owner plans to install a glass canopy over parts of the usable residual space. Additional usable residual space is provided in front of retail uses along the avenue. There, set off from the public sidewalk by street trees, is a small area with additional steel chair units and a granite bench on the south wall. It is perfect for the brief stop.\n"

            "details": "Sloping up and down as it connects West 49th and 50th Streets between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, this plaza represents a hybrid public space typology: a space that serves as back yard and front yard at the same time. Sandwiched between the back of an office tower and the front of a residential tower, the plaza forges a common ground for office workers, residents, and visitors. Indeed, on any given day, its large, diverse community of users might include lawyers from Cravath Swaine & Moore, advertising account representatives from Ogilvey & Mather, condominium owners, health club members, restaurant and cinema patrons, and neighboring Clinton residents.\n\nMixed-use developments such as One Worldwide Plaza engage the social potential of mixed-use development when they provide well located, well designed, highly functional public space for mixing. This plaza capably meets that challenge. Its placement between the two buildings was clever, gaining critical mass and allegiance from two large sets of users. Its half-acre size, numerous movable chairs, comfortable ledge seating, food service at north and south ends, decorative water fountain, and landscaping of trees and shrubs render it highly functional for the diverse audience. Neon-vested private security guards maintain building management’s sense of behavioral decorum, even to the point of asking a shirtless sun worshiper to put his shirt back on.\nThe plaza’s theme of commonality is subtly reinforced in other ways. The red-brick paving integrates visually the façades of the bookend buildings. The iconic sculptural fountain is composed of four standing bronze nude women balancing, almost like caryatids, a large metal globe on their heads, while four disembodied male heads spout water into the pool below. The allusion to the famed bronze sculpture Atlas (1937), by Lee Lawrie, shouldering the world’s burdens on the west side of Fifth Avenue in front of a Rockefeller Center building between West 50th and 51st Streets, is unmistakable, even admirable, conceptually connecting this development to Rockefeller Center and its superb mixing of buildings and public space, although the owners probably had their development’s name, One Worldwide Plaza, more in mind. The star-shaped fountain ledge is inviting and heavily used on hot summer days.\nAs a space slightly off the beaten path, the plaza is helped by such draws as the movie theaters on its West 50th Street side. Although not required by the legal actions creating the space, the theaters draw additional persons that ensure an active and varied group of users during evening as well as daylight hours. Lined with storefronts, the elliptical arcades at the base of the office building connect the plaza to Eighth Avenue. The public restrooms are located inside the arcade immediately north of the entrance off the plaza. Situated at the base of the office building near Eighth Avenue, with an elevator closer to West 49th Street and an escalator closer to West 50th Street, subway access areas connect the plaza to the rest of the city.\n"

            "details": "Some urban plazas are designed with narrow width and considerable depth relative to the street. This urban plaza on the north side of West 37th Street, 75 feet west of Fifth Avenue, reverses the ratio, employing a wider street frontage and shallower depth to great effect. The proportions keep it closer and exposed to sidewalk and street, and the result is an open, less claustrophobic feeling than that experienced at other similarly sized spaces.\nA Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. sign is prominently displayed at the western end, practically guaranteeing that the space will meet certain standards of excellence. Although advertising at spaces is strictly limited by the Zoning Resolution, the idea of encouraging tenants or owners to identify themselves prominently in or with a space has a certain appeal, if only because the condition of the space then reflects positively or negatively on that tenant or owner and renders them more responsible. Here, the quality shows through. Planters on the western side are well-landscaped with trees, overflowing ivy, and flowers. Elegant marble benches and ledges provide fixed seating, and movable café chairs and tables are scattered about. Stylish stanchions balancing globes of light lead up to the front lobby.\n"

            "details": "When the AT&T Building, designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, first enrolled in Manhattan’s skyline in 1983, most of the attention focused on its split-pediment Chippendale top and its postmodern iconic meaning. Roughly ten years later, however, when ownership of the building shifted from AT&T to the Sony Corporation, the focus shifted downward. That is because in 1992 Sony applied to the City Planning Commission for permission to pack Sony retail store space into most of the 60-foot-tall open-air arcade encircling the building on the west side of Madison Avenue and on East 55th and 56th Streets. The proposal bluntly raised the question when, if ever, privatization of public space should be formally allowed.\nSpecifically, Sony proposed to eliminate 10,560 square feet of arcade, reducing it from 14,102 to 3,542 square feet, and to replace it with 6,050 square feet of indoor retail space, much of it along the Madison Avenue frontage. Were this all to the proposal, the answer would be easy, since Sony not only would be decreasing public space but would also be increasing private floor area. What made this a matter for legitimate public debate was Sony’s sweetener: its offer to enlarge its covered pedestrian space, located at the rear of the building and connecting East 55th and 56th Streets, from 5,625 square feet to 9,731 square feet and to render it climate controlled. Sony was offering an additional 4,106 square feet of covered pedestrian space and a general enhancement of its qualities in exchange for a reduction of 10,560 square feet of “as-of-right” arcade. Sony also proposed to eliminate 1,324 square feet of retail space fronting the covered pedestrian space, and to replace the AT&T Infoquest Center with its own exhibit center, called SonyWonder Technology Lab, in the annex.\nThe zoning arithmetic worked out as follows. Reflecting the judgment that, square foot for square foot, a covered pedestrian space is more valuable to the public and more expensive to construct than an arcade, the Zoning Resolution generally authorized a substantially greater bonus per square foot of covered pedestrian space. In the Sony case, at a rate of 11 square feet of bonus floor area for every square foot of covered pedestrian space, the additional covered pedestrian space would generate a bonus of 45,166 square feet. At a rate of three square feet of bonus floor area for every square foot of arcade, the lost 10,560 square feet of arcade would reduce the building’s zoning floor area entitlement by 31,680 square feet. Thus, even after Sony would have constructed 6,050 square feet of new retail space in the old arcade space, that would still leave it with an unused entitlement of more than 7,000 square feet of building. And that would be before counting the 1,324 square foot reduction of retail space in the covered pedestrian space. In short, in the arcane world of zoning bonuses for privately owned public spaces, it could be argued, the public would emerge more than whole, with less, but more valuable, public space. The City agreed with this reasoning and approved Sony’s application in 1992, concluding that the public benefit associated with the changes exceeded the public benefit associated with the existing configuration.\nToday’s covered pedestrian space, an impressive, glass-covered, three-story, through-block corridor may be entered from East 55th or 56th Streets under the remaining portion of outdoor arcade left over from the original design, or through the 80-foot-high granite entry arch and intensely vertical private lobby of the Sony building from Madison Avenue. Enclosed above by a half-barrel vaulted glass ceiling supported by white metal lattice and transverse white industrial beams, and at both ends by glass, the space is light and airy. Indeed, in physical form, it comes the closest of any through-block privately owned public space in the city toward evoking the nineteenth-century European arcade, with Connecticut granite for the patterned floor and columns, even if the half vault and squeezed corridor evoke half an arcade, and recent intrusions, including a large frame with light bulbs hanging from the ceiling and bump-out windows from the sides, clutter the air. The space’s overall transparency and axis create a convincing visual, as well as functional, engagement with 590 Madison Avenue’s glass-enclosed through block arcade and covered pedestrian space to the north, forging two blocks of protected mid-block passage as well as access through Trump Tower to Fifth Avenue.\nFueled partly by the SonyWonder Technology Lab, partly by food and retail offerings, and partly by its highly functional amenities for passive activities, the space receives heavy use. Groups of schoolchildren noisily queue up at and near the Sony exhibit located in an annex at the northern end, alternately amused and perplexed by a mechanical barker, equipped with live actor’s voice, that interacts conversationally. Numerous silver metal movable tables and chairs, the same type as those used at 590 Madison and part of Trump, are collected principally in the two anterooms located off both ends of the through block passage. Here, office workers, shoppers, tourists, and other individuals avoid the commotion of the linear corridor as they enjoy typical public space activities of eating, reading, talking, and resting. Additional chairs and tables line the corridor, and the space has abjured the double-loaded retail layout of a shopping mall for most of its length. A destination restaurant joins convenience retail on the western side, and users with long memories and deep pockets might recall the Quilted Giraffe, one of the city’s most famous and expensive restaurants. Public restrooms are available at the SonyWonder annex.\nAs for the lost arcade spaces, it would be a mistake to romanticize them. During much of the year, they were cold, dark, and windy. They were most usable during the dog days of summer, when their high vaulted ceilings and heavy granite arches and columns psychologically, if not physically, fostered coolness, much the way the dark, mysterious interiors of cathedrals have done for centuries. Remaining arcade space still lines East 55th and 56th Street sides of the building, retaining the intriguing portholes visibly punched above into the wall.\n"

Although hidden behind construction scaffolding and padlocked gate at a recent site visit, when accessible the plaza makes a consequential dent in the neighborhood’s quest for green public open space, providing a small fountain, trees and bushes, seating, and a secluded area at the rear.\nEntered through a gate, past flanking planters filled with trees, the narrow, deep, rectangular space parallels the eastern side of the building next to its unbonused arcade lined with tall columns. A semicircular fountain and pool are framed by landscaping. Further north, up several steps, is a distinct area surrounded by wood benches attached to planter walls. The sun bounces off the yellow brick wall at back to warm and lighten what might otherwise be a cold and dark atmosphere. The remaining ribbon of residential plaza adorns the front of the building and the front door on East 38th Street.\n"

            "details": "Set on the north side of East 72nd Street between the F.D.R. Drive and York Avenue, this public park appropriates many of the elements found at Paley Park, the celebrated privately owned private space discussed in the HarperCollins through block arcade profile. Both spaces are rectangular in shape, with similar south-facing frontage widths and square footages (this space is 4,904 square feet, Paley Park is 4,200 square feet). Both have rows of high-branching trees (14 red maples here, 17 honey locusts there), uplit at night, spreading a wide canopy over the entire surface. Both employ rough-stone block paving that extends to the base of the trees. Both furnish numerous movable Bertoia tables and chairs that users love to arrange in flexible and individualized patterns. Both locate gatehouses with park attendant or guard near their entrances. Both provide approachable waterfalls at the back that calm and cool users. Both were designed by the same landscape architect.\nWith all these similarities, why do the spaces feel so different? The answer lies in the broader physical contexts in which these spaces are situated. Smack in the heart of midtown Manhattan, on the north side of East 53rd Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, Paley Park palliates the excesses of one of the densest urban commercial districts in the world. Its serenity is especially valued in a neighborhood full of crowded sidewalks and encroaching skyscrapers. Paley Park is an oasis of sanity.\nBy comparison, this public park on East 72nd Street has far less of a contending physical assemblage to counteract. The neighborhood is not the central business district of Manhattan. The openness of the East River is easily seen and felt. While the space’s western side is adjacent to a tower, the three other sides are, by New York City standards, unobstructed. Ironically, freedom from bulk can deflate the value of open space. Still, with dappled sunlight dancing on the park floor, trees peacefully swaying in the wind, water gracefully cascading down the water steps, and plenty of movable chairs, tables, and wooden and granite benches, it is easy to understand why the space is consistently occupied by regular park devotees throughout the warmer-weather months.\n\n"

            "details": "Although a restrictive declaration that was filed by the owner in 1984, several months after the City amended the lot’s zoning designation, refers to the space as a park, it actually resembles zoning’s residential plaza typology, found primarily in the upper east and west sides of the city. Occupying the full blockfront on the west side of Washington Street between Jane and Horatio Streets, the space is rectangular, comfortably proportioned, surfaced in brick, relatively open, and surrounded on its three street sides by a red iron fence that enforces the restricted hours of access.\nInside, a long, serpentine, stone ledge makes its way around the northern, western, and southern sides, providing numerous places for sitting next to a landscaping of plants. In the middle of the western edge is a water wall, with five cascading vertical chutes topped by decorative metal medallions sporting images of beavers, a pilgrim, and a Native American. Four old millstones placed on the park surface reinforce the connection to American history. Fixed benches and movable aluminum chairs furnish added seating among the several trees.\nAlthough the space is physically detached from the residential building’s front entrance, it is nonetheless well integrated. Apartment windows and balconies look out onto the space, making it feel like a well observed backyard in service of “defensible space” principles articulated by such urban observers as Oscar Newman. The combination of time-tested amenities, pleasant proportions, integration with host building, and nearby residential population makes this a valuable neighborhood space.\n"

A sign in front of the fenced, deep, rectangular space announces hours of 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. No record of City approval for restricted hours has been found. Furthermore, at a recent site visit, the gates were locked during the very hours specified by the sign, and the sparse landscaping and half-filled garbage bags behind the gates were hardly inviting in any event.\nThe remainder of space closer to the host residential building to the north exhibits the two most common “as-of-right” plaza uses at residential buildings: a semicircular drop-off driveway with porte cochere next to the southeast corner of Second Avenue and East 74th Street, and extra sidewalk in front of the commercial frontage bump-out along Second Avenue. The corner is marked with a round planter and sittable ledge, while five more planters marching down Second Avenue have ledges rendered unusable by tiny rail fences. A lone bench is on the sidewalk side of the third planter.\n"

            "details": "Surrounded by Water Street, the southwest side of Old Slip, and South Street, this building has two of the largest outdoor public spaces in the city and some of the best views of Brooklyn and the East River. The plaza at street level is a long, rectangular, windswept sea of brick extending from Water Street to South Street along the southwest side of the building. Near Water Street is a stairwell leading to a defunct below-ground shopping mall. A channel of water used to flow from the plaza toward and down the stairwell.\n\nVisually, the plaza looks much larger than its legally required size, because it is seamlessly joined to the City-owned triangular Vietnam Veterans Plaza, formerly known as Jeanette Park, to the southwest. The owner of 55 Water Street was required by a City special permit to rebuild and maintain Jeanette Park, and the privately owned and publicly owned public spaces appear to function as one space.\nAgainst the foreground of the plaza’s open brick surface, and just across the invisible border between privately owned and City-owned space, is the New York Vietnam Veterans Memorial, an upright rectangular slab composed of translucent greenish-glass blocks etched with the contents of poignant letters and other writings from American soldiers in Vietnam to their families and friends back in the United States. The wall is pierced by two portals, framed in granite, that symbolically allow the viewer to “enter,” however briefly, the soldier’s world before passing safely to the other side. At night, the monument is lit from within, creating an eerie, ghostlike sensation befitting the subject matter. The memorial was a product of a design competition initiated in 1982 by a City-established commission, and the winning entry was conceived and completed by architects Peter Wormser and William Fellows, and writer John Ferrandino, in 1984 to 1985.\nOn the Vietnam Veterans Plaza side of the memorial is an amphitheater with stepped brick seating chiseled out of the grade change. At the top of the brick steps are stubby black-metal bollards strung with lights, which create a necklace effect in the evening. The remaining area southwest features round concrete benches that sprout like mushrooms under a forest of tall trees spreading their protective green canopy.\nThree stories above Water Street, the elevated plaza is one of only six substantially elevated outdoor spaces in the city. The others are at One Bankers Trust Plaza, Trump Tower, Murray Hill Mews, 622 Third Avenue, and 300 East 59th Street. Unlike the others, it is the only elevated space expressly created under the Zoning Resolution’s specific provision for elevated plazas. Entry is from Water Street, up the escalators or stairs, or from South Street, up a narrow stairwell. In past years, the space has been closed from time to time because, among other things, repairs to the escalators had to be made. While repair, renovation, and construction projects may legitimately preclude public access for a limited period, they cripple public use when such projects linger for months or even years, or recur on an all-too-regular basis. In this case, the City and owner have exchanged numerous letters in the past about lack of access, most recently addressing the issue in 1997.\nThe space itself is interesting, especially for the views it permits of the East River and Brooklyn, with its skyline redolent of 19th- and early 20th-century New York. To the northeast across Old Slip is a bird’s-eye view of the building that is home to New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Commission. The elevated plaza measures close to an acre, divided between an empty flat brick surface and a curving raised terrace composed of planters, water pools, sittable ledges, and wood benches. Here are semiprivate and private areas, protected from the wind, that are particularly pleasant during hot summer days.\nIn the outdoor public space lexicon, “elevated” and “sunken” are controversial qualifiers. Such spaces, especially the elevated ones, can be remote, inconvenient, even scary, removed from the familiarity and security of street eyes and ears. They can also harm the vitality of the sidewalk itself, by creating a lacuna in the adjacent ground plane. At its inception, the zoning definition of the “as-of-right” plaza precluded the “elevated” or “sunken” plaza, requiring that all plazas be no more than five feet above or more than 12 feet below the curb level. In part to accommodate this space, the City in 1968 enacted a zoning amendment allowing elevated plazas, following a discretionary review by the City Planning Commission. The City approved this space in the hope that it would become one component in a second-level pedestrian circulation network extending east over the F.D.R. Drive to the river. Like the effort in the Special Greenwich Street Development District, which attempted to create another second-level pedestrian circulation network on the other side of downtown, this one never came to fruition. The profile of public spaces at One Bankers Trust Plaza discusses the Special Greenwich Street Development District plan in more detail.\nThe remaining public space at 55 Water Street includes an arcade that wraps around half of the Water Street side of the building and continues along the full southwest side. Additional plaza area that is effectively more sidewalk may be found on Water Street between the entrance to the elevated plaza escalators and Old Slip.\n"

            "details": "The plaza in front of the former General Motors Building on the east side of Fifth Avenue between East 58th and 59th Streets is undergoing a radical identity change. To begin with, it will henceforth be known as the Trump International Plaza at the General Motors Building. Furthermore, it will virtually eliminate the conspicuously sunken plaza at its heart. Finally, it will be famous, seen on a daily basis by more people than see all the other privately owned public spaces in the city combined.\nThe design embraced by new owner Donald Trump and partners fills in the majority of sunken plaza with below-street-level retail tenants and covers them with street-level plaza. It will be hard to find many who will lament the loss. In an urban environment favoring street activity and easy access, sunken and elevated plazas have struggled to find their place. Declining to complement the Grand Army Plaza across Fifth Avenue with another street-level confection, the original architect Edward Durell Stone chose instead to unhinge entirely from the street. That strategy could be deemed courageous or cowardly. Certainly the street-level competition was daunting. The Grand Army Plaza is a vibrant example of beaux-arts urban design and civic philanthropy. An initial concept by sculptor Karl Bitter, an implementing design by Thomas Hastings, and Joseph Pulitzer’s lubricating $50,000 contribution in 1912 for the construction of a centerpiece marble fountain topped by Bitter’s bronze sculpture of the Greek goddess Pomona, laid the foundation. To the north is Augustus Saint-Gaudens’ statue of General William Tecumseh Sherman astride his horse. The French Renaissance façade of the Plaza Hotel brilliantly encloses the space to the west, and Central Park beckons further north. As a piece of urban design, the plaza to this day masterfully accommodates the unruly movements of pedestrians, taxis, horse-drawn carriages, limousines, and private cars that venture on and across its surface.\nIn contrast, the old General Motors plaza created a large, dark cavity in the ground plane. Carpeted with astroturf and crammed with umbrella-topped tables and chairs, it was used by a full-service restaurant and bar during the warmer months of the year and left empty at other times. With its elimination, the questions that arose about whether the restaurant was legally authorized to operate in the public space become moot. The city is now left with three substantial outdoor sunken public spaces, at the McGraw-Hill, Paramount Plaza, and Citigroup Center buildings.\nThe new design still plays, ever so slightly, with grade changes. The space itself will now be elevated several steps above the public sidewalk. It retains a small reminder of the sunken space between East 58th and 59th Streets close to Fifth Avenue, with a stairwell leading down to a small landing in front of a 37-foot-wide glass entrance to the below-grade retail. An above-grade green marble roof covers the retail entrance, and an above-grade platform surrounded by steps on three sides is located still further east. Two narrow, 65-foot-long rectangular pools with water jets and encircling sittable ledges make apparent reference to the Seagram plaza on Park Avenue. The existing terraces at north and south ends will remain, slightly higher than the rest of the space, decorated with rows of trees and marble benches.\nThe most famous geography of the plaza will be north of the building’s arcade, where new tenant CBS has established a studio for its relaunched morning talk show. Windows and cameras look directly onto the plaza and on-air personnel venture outside to greet onlookers, allowing millions of morning television viewers across the country to become familiar with the space. How this works will have to be followed carefully so that this part of the plaza maintains its status as a “public” space. More plaza space that is functionally extra sidewalk will remain on Madison Avenue. When this project is complete, developer Trump will have renovated privately owned public spaces at two of Central Park’s four corners. His other Central Park public space is located at the Trump International Hotel and Tower, at the southwest corner of Central Park.\n"

            "details": "The primary space of this residential plaza, located at the back of the building, is a narrow rectangle extending west from the northwest corner of Third Avenue and East 63rd Street. Marking that corner is a large, pergola-like structure with rusticated stone block columns, trellised sides, and open trellis roof. The modest planter at center does not merit the structure that encloses it. A ledge bench occupies the middle of the space to the west, and planters, some on an elevated terrace even further west, are scattered about. With its southern orientation and openness toward the avenue, the space receives plentiful sunlight.\nThe area on East 64th Street west of Third Avenue is split into usable and visual residual space. Framed by an arcade, the usable residual space serves as a brick-paved entrance for the building. Its western side is festooned with truncated ornamental classical columns, arrayed on pedestals, and embraced by the curving planter ledge that is good for sitting. Like mushrooms in the forest, additional classical columns emerge out of the ground of the well-landscaped visual residual space.\n"

            "details": "At 21,872 square feet, this plaza is the smallest of three Harrison and Abramovitz-designed spaces set in front of immense office towers developed by the Rockefeller Center interests on the west side of Sixth Avenue between West 47th and 50th Streets. The concentration of such large, relatively empty public spaces and deep building setbacks stirred up thorny urban planning questions soon after their appearance, and contributed in 1975 to the adoption of a zoning amendment for plazas that would dramatically alter the nature of future spaces at office buildings. A fuller discussion of this issue is provided in the profile of the public space at 1251 Sixth Avenue.\n\nUnlike its two sibling spaces to the north, at the McGraw-Hill building and 1251 Sixth Avenue, this plaza does not fully span its blockfront on Sixth Avenue. A wing of building juts out to the public sidewalk at the northwest corner of West 47th Street and Sixth Avenue, providing a southern enclosure to the plaza and mitigating the feeling of monumentality. Given the location of the wing, the plaza cannot mimic the flanking two-terrace design of its siblings, and instead provides one elevated terrace at the southwest corner of West 48th Street and Sixth Avenue, with four fixed wooden benches, shrubbery, and trees. The ledge bordering the sidewalk is heavily used by people watchers. An entrance to the subway and underground concourse at Rockefeller Center is also located near here. Television’s embrace of public space, shown daily at the plaza of the General Motors Building at Trump International Plaza through CBS, is realized here by the Fox network.\nLike its sibling Rockefeller Center buildings, this one has a covered, outdoor, through-block space at back which, unlike their spaces, is required to be open and accessible to the public. This two-story through block arcade constitutes the final link in a meandering four-block chain that starts at West 44th Street with the through block connection at Millennium Broadway, and continues with the through block connections at Bertelsmann and United States Trust. Here, retail stores and a café front the arcade. The festive banners that once lined the space have been removed. At a recent site visit, tables and chairs associated with the café were arrayed in the middle. No record of City approval for such use has been found. Escalators to the below-grade subway concourse and Rockefeller Center underground complex are located on the western side.\n"

The lower level is entered up a ramp from the sidewalk or up several steps from the building side. Further west is the upper level, accessible up a stairwell from the sidewalk at the plaza’s western edge or from the lower level to the east. At recent site visits, gates at the stairwell have been locked, even though they are required to be open at all times.\nA letter from the owner to the Board of Standards and Appeals in support of a variance described a “landscaped” plaza, but the reality of the space is more hard-edged and urban. A sea of purple brick engulfs the surface and encircling walls. A semicircular water wall, made of rough-hewn stone tile, would be pleasant, but it has not been operational during recent site visits. Several fixed chairs and benches are scattered about, and the ledge around the water wall is sittable. To the extent it exists, the landscaping consists primarily of trees, concentrated in the front part of the upper level and emerging from tall planters constructed of synthetic material. The additional plaza is extra open space that was provided in support of the variance.\nThe remainder of plaza is a ribbon, wrapped around the three street sides of the building, elevated along Second Avenue and sunken along East 48th Street in front of storefronts. This plaza should not be confused with another, more usable plaza associated with the Dag Hammarskjold name, located one block south behind the Dag Hammarskjold Tower at the northwest corner of East 46th Street and Second Avenue.\n"

The plaza occupies Broadway and Seventh Avenue sides of this full-block office building between West 39th and 40th Streets. In June, 1998, after a fashion industry building tenant received permission from the City to install temporary seating, tree planters, and mobile exhibits celebrating 100 years of fashion on the Broadway side, the space burst alive for the summer. Transitory structures and activities can quickly and inexpensively animate a space for an owner not yet ready to make major upgrades of an existing “as-of-right” plaza. An information kiosk for the fashion industry now occupies the northeast corner of Seventh Avenue and West 39th Street.\nThe plaza also features two sculptures, one industry-related and one not. In the Broadway plaza area on a small platform is a bronze bust of Golda Meir, by Beatrice Goldfine. The Seventh Avenue plaza space displays a life-sized bronze sculpture, entitled The Garment Worker (1984), by Judith Weiler, depicting a man at a sewing machine representing the first immigrants who came to New York and provided cheap labor for the manufacture of clothing. The sculpture was a gift from the sculptor, members of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, and private designers and manufacturers. A recent site visit revealed that a small café on Seventh Avenue near West 39th Street had placed its tables and chairs on the plaza. No record of City approval for this use has been found. The arcade is located on the Broadway side of the building.\n"

While this sort of simplicity is permitted by the Zoning Resolution, not all through block arcades take this tack. For example, although the HarperCollins through block arcade is similarly stripped of functional amenities, it presents a sleek design and becomes more useful by forging a two-block chain with the covered pedestrian space at Olympic Tower. More ambitiously, the through block arcade at Park Avenue Plaza furnishes a climate-controlled environment that provides seating, tables, a food kiosk, and public restrooms. Interestingly, both this and the Park Avenue Plaza through block arcades received the same floor area bonus per square foot.

The corner location also allows the space to co-opt the openness of the adjacent intersection of Third Avenue and East 84th Street, giving it a feeling of size greater than that suggested by its otherwise modest 4,250 square feet. The space is divided into outer and inner areas. The outer area at the corner itself is open, brick-paved, with square planter and good ledge seating, regularly occupied by neighborhood residents and passersby. The inner area attracts users though landscaping and, until recently, water. People clustered on and around a sittable, serpentine ledge surrounding two small waterfalls. The naturalistic waterfall tumbled out of a miniature forest down a stone whose source was, literally, a grotto in Pakistan. A more formal waterfall started with small jets of spray that coalesced along stepped bricks into a pool. With the option of dipping feet into the water, this ledge seating was even more in demand than the corner ledge seating. In short, it is worth exploring where the water amenity has gone.\nAlthough the building entry corridor is separated by canopy from the rest of the space, it has not caused any lack of stewardship here. In fact, the doorman boasts that building management cleans the plaza 10 times a day; even if an exaggeration, the fact that he proudly proclaimed this fact, along with the actual quality of maintenance, are commendable.\n"

Here, a combination of cellar floor public space and covered pedestrian space furnishes a small, indoor, climate-controlled area with black café tables and chairs and an adjacent food service. The design employs high vaulted ceilings, glass windows with exterior glimpses, warm lighting, and a brick patio surface to reasonable effect. The space designer labeled an outdoor portion of below-ground space a public winter garden, conjuring up grand images that are quickly deflated by the dimensions and amenities. In the past, the outdoor portion has furnished seating and a tree. Back at street level, the remaining part of the covered pedestrian space is located under the overhanging building, open to the air and serviceable as a smoking area. The triangular cutout next to the escalators hints at the space below.\n"

A diminutive rectangular urban plaza on East 44th Street fills the tower setback space, and features a round, brick, flower-filled planter with seating ledge. A loading dock provides occasional interest to the east. At a recent site visit, the three movable chairs were not in evidence. Immediately north, a three-story-high arcade covers the entrance to the private through-block lobby.\nOn the East 45th Street side of the building is more arcade space made interesting only because physical and legal typologies diverge: part of the arcade is under the building, as a physical arcade space is meant to be, but part of it is instead under a canopy, as only a legal arcade might be. The sidewalk widening completes the public spaces here. Tiny dish planters holding bushes and ivy are scattered about.\n"

            "details": "Like Trump Plaza’s residential plaza one block north across Third Avenue, this split residential plaza, just east of Third Avenue on East 60th and 61st Streets, is almost invisible to Third Avenue pedestrians. This is regrettable, because both plaza spaces possess qualities commending them to the brief pauses favored by rushing passersby. For example, the smaller usable residual space on East 61st Street in front of the residential tower’s primary entrance is perfectly designed for a quick stop. The sidewalk frontage has sittable granite ledges. With a perimeter shaped like the croix de guerre, the upwardly sloping approach to the building is flanked with benches with backs and ledges for drop-in, drop-out seating. Plantings behind the seating are unusually rejuvenating, exhibiting a wide range of colorful hues set at the floor of larger shrubs and trees. The space functions under the watchful eye of the doorman, who can be seen monitoring activities from behind glass front doors. Like the Trump space, this plaza does not discriminate functionally between members of the public and residents of the building.\nThe larger, primary space on East 60th Street appears to enjoy a regular following, in large measure because food takeout services front the plaza, and movable white café tables and chairs accommodate lunchtime crowds. Portable signs among the tables inform members of the public that they are free to sit at the tables and chairs without obligation to purchase. The change in use patterns here over the years has been dramatic. In the late 1980s, the space had a spare ambiance, the building’s windows were generally opaque, and, except for a record store, most of the retail activities were specialized services. Now, with the two-story façade at back rendered transparent and leased to a restaurant, coupled with additional food service to the west, the owners have successfully Impressed use and design changes to activate the primary space. Round ledges on the eastern side in front of landscaping provide additional seating. Like several other spaces in the neighborhood, this one in past years has suffered theft of a public space plaque, presumably in the thief’s belief that its brass content had value. At a recent site visit, plaques were intact and in place.\n"

Its orientation, however, is outward, since its sole purpose, as revealed by usage, is to provide a viewing platform onto the sidewalk and street. The two long seating ledges along Madison Avenue are regularly occupied by momentarily-paused pedestrians, and the interaction between them and the moving pedestrians creates time-honored urban street interactions of observer and observed. Small wooden planters with evergreens and two benches are located along the side street sidewalk. A tiny arcade covers the main entrance.\nWith the Kaufman Organization as developer and M. Paul Friedberg as landscape architect, the only surprise here is the relative absence of whimsy or creativity. A comparison may be drawn with another Kaufman space, at 747 Third Avenue, that made much out of little.\n"

Two fixed black-tile planter structures contradict their exterior rugged image by presenting a delicate array of multi-colored annuals, along with six trees, in various ground- and waist-level recesses and trays. Hidden from street view on the planter’s interior walls are six built-in concrete benches. Perhaps in response to the fact that smokers have migrated to outdoor plazas and arcades as last refuges for lighting up, a sign prohibits smoking in a portion of this space.\nUnlike most outdoor public spaces in Manhattan, the space here is part of a lower-rise physical fabric that includes the roughly eight-story slab of the host building, a bulkier older building across Boerem Place, and a row of four-story structures on Livingston Street. One block north along Boerem Place is Brooklyn’s civic space, including Brooklyn Borough Hall, a Greek Revival structure. In the distance down Adams Street, a continuation of Boerem Place, is a view of Manhattan and the Empire State Building.\n"

            "details": "Hidden behind rows of trees that are parallel to the sidewalk, the Sovereign’s plaza on the north side of East 58th Street between Sutton Place South and First Avenue surprises the user with its large size and variety. The space is divided into two areas by the through-block driveway. The area to the east is entered through a small opening, squeezed between a black column supporting a canopy and a low brick ledge. A tiny wooden planter is oddly situated immediately inside, as if motor vehicles needed to be blocked from gaining entry. A large planter filled with trees and ground cover dominates the middle of the brick-surfaced plaza. Further east is wooden bench seating attached to several smaller planters, as well as ledge seating.\nThe plaza area west of the driveway is more naturalistic. A forest of trees covers most of its surface and seating is available on ledges. This space functions as a transitional zone for the ultimate surprise: a secluded park, reached by angled pathway northward, that was closed and under apparent construction at a recent site visit. Fashioned as a condition of a variance granted by the City’s Board of Standards and Appeals, the park at one time displayed a sign announcing that it was off-limits to all but residents of the Sovereign. That sign has now been removed, and this interesting space deserves greater public use. The gravel entrance extends to a marvelous verdant lawn, unusual for public spaces. Grass is always a difficult ground cover to maintain, in cities as in suburbs, especially in contrast to concrete, brick, terrazzo, granite, and even in comparison with hardier natural ground covers. Here, management’s stewardship is apparent not only in the quality of the lawn, but in the highly manicured landscaping, including trees, within and surrounding it. In addition to the lawn itself, three dark wooden benches provide seating. The difficult question always presented by such spaces is how much public use it would take to undermine the park’s carefully designed tranquility. On East 59th Street is a sliver of slightly elevated plaza in front of a restaurant.\n"

            "details": "Located at the southeast corner of Third Avenue and East 48th Street, the urban plaza and arcade expand the roster of fanciful public spaces, including 747 Third Avenue, 200 Water Street, and 77 Water Street, developed by the Kaufman organization. Here, the signature element is a gigantic chessboard adorning the wall of an abutting building at the eastern edge of the urban plaza.\nA game is in progress. Like pieces from a magnetic traveling chess kit, giant blue disks outlined with images of pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queen, and king, compete against giant green disks. At the moment, the two sides appear evenly matched, with blue and green having captured one pawn and one knight apiece. At left is a flag with the message, “White moves.” To discover whether the blue or green disks are white, whether either of the players is Gary Kasparov, or how often the pieces are moved, a nearby sign suggests a visit to the building concierge. Additional touches confirm the Kaufman ancestry. Oversized whimsical metal footprints track east or west on top of metal grates in the East 48th Street sidewalk. A plaque gives credit to the designers.\nThe spaces break with tradition in other respects. “As-of-right” arcades are normally small in size and inconspicuous in design. This one is neither. To begin with, the ratio of arcade to plaza space is the reverse of most conditions, the arcade being larger than the plaza. Furthermore, unlike a common arcade’s narrow, rectilinear geometry, this one is curvaceous, relieved of 90-degree angles by the building’s curvilinear architecture. The arcade encircles the building, culminating in a capacious, slightly sunken area on East 48th Street displaying an antique car and coach. A small gangplank bridges the sunken area, conjuring up a moat in front of the building entrance, waiting to be filled with water. The urban plaza to the east supplies the functional amenities. Below the chessboard are four fixed wooden tables, each surrounded by four fixed backless wooden seats. Four additional benches flank north and south sides. To the south is an elevated platform whose approach up an overly steep ramp is rewarded by the best seat in the house.\nWith more than 500 privately owned public spaces, it is desirable that the public be able to distinguish one space from another. Spaces developed by the Kaufman organization usually may be relied upon to project unique personalities. Memorable spaces, like this one with its gigantic chessboard, become points of orientation and association that connect people to their physical environments.\n"

            "details": "Although the owner’s restrictive declaration and the City’s special permit principally employ the dry nomenclature of approved permanent passageway, the physical reality is principally a splendid, renovated, historic, multistory atrium ringed with several levels of overlooking galleries and topped with a decorative glass-domed skylight. Entered from the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 55th and 56th Streets through an historic building façade, the Fifth Avenue atrium is unlike any other interior privately owned public space in the city simply because it is old. The space is neither large nor ostentatious. It employs muted colors of interior surface materials enlivened by the light cast through the skylight and the glass windows of its Fifth Avenue façade, designed in 1910 by French glassmaker René Lalique. Recently restored and rededicated, the windows depict delicately rendered flowers and intertwined vines. Stairs at the southwest corner of the atrium or an elevator at the northwest corner provide access for the best view, seen from the upper-level corridors from the inside out.\nUnfortunately, at recent site visits, the scene described in the previous paragraph was unrecognizable, because the department store occupying adjacent space in this historic structure had taken over the atrium for its own purposes and filled it with displays for selling goods. A large decorative object hung above, making it impossible to perceive that this space was, indeed, a skylit atrium. The floor was so crowded with salespersons, customers, and display counters that it was difficult to make way forward toward the office lobby further west along the so-called “clear path” of the approved permanent passageway. On the second floor next to the Lalique windows along Fifth Avenue, tables and chairs occupied by persons eating a served lunch made a close-up view of the skillful design unattainable. Legal instruments governing this space expressly prohibit retail sales activity in the atrium, and no other record of City approval for this commercial takeover has been found.\nThe provision of public space here is one aspect of a complex historic preservation effort. Two buildings were designated landmarks by the City’s Landmarks Preservation Commission: 712 Fifth Avenue and 714 Fifth Avenue. 712 Fifth Avenue was previously known as the Rizzoli Building and before that the 712 Fifth Avenue Building. Designed by Albert S. Gottlieb in 1908-1909, it accommodated commercial uses even as its five-story limestone façade matched the then-residential context of the neighborhood. 714 Fifth Avenue, originally built in 1871 but redone in 1907-1908 by Woodruff Leeming, was known as the Coty Building after the French purveyor of perfumes, Francois Coty, who leased the building in 1910. The two buildings have been partially preserved and restored for use as a department store, and an office skyscraper has been constructed behind and above the buildings to the west.\nIf operated correctly, the atrium space may be fruitfully compared with the privately owned public space at the nearby New York Palace Hotel. There, the outdoor courtyard and much of the surrounding Villard Houses were retained and restored, even as the new hotel arose behind and above the historic structures. Although such hybrid preservation efforts disturb some advocates of historic preservation, they enjoy the support of others who believe that a balance between development and preservation is politically and economically essential in modern cities. Another public space, a tiny building entrance recess area, is located in front of the office lobby entrance west of Fifth Avenue on West 56th Street.\n"

            "details": "Because the current 52 Broadway was the product of a building renovation rather than a totally new development, and because the spacing of existing columns and existing floor-to-ceiling height disqualified the existing space from receiving a floor area bonus under the Zoning Resolution’s design standards for a through block arcade, the developer applied to the City’s Board of Standards and Appeals, which granted a variance and special permit for a through block arcade equivalent, as well as for additional zoning floor area equal to the amount the developer would have received as a bonus for a qualifying through block arcade.\nThe simple, brightly lit, indoor, through-block space doubles as the building lobby and connects Broadway and New Street south of Exchange Alley. Two rows of recessed lights lead the pedestrian along the brick floor corridor from Broadway, past several retail stores and the building’s elevators to the north, and a white marble and steel-clad wall to the south. Near New Street, the space jogs north and descends by escalator to the New Street level and several additional retail facilities. The space does not provide seating.\nFor pedestrians seeking a covered pathway alternative from New Street all the way to Trinity Place, this space may be combined with 55 Broadway across Broadway. For this walk, Broadway is literally the high ground, a sort of continental divide that demonstrates that downtown Manhattan has topography.\nHours of access to this space remain an unresolved issue. The variance and special permit text authorizing the space, and the supporting plans, are silent as to required hours. Indoor public spaces in the city are always open weekdays during business hours, and sometimes open evenings and weekends. The owner has already agreed to keep the space open weekdays, from 6:30 am to 6:30 pm, excluding bank holidays. Further discussions between the City and owner are contemplated.\n"

            "details": "The most interesting fact here has nothing to do with the extant public space, a small plaza facing Hanover Square between Water and Pearl Streets, renovated several years ago and principally composed of a languidly curving series of steps leading to a small terrace in front of the main entrance. The “public space” that interests is one no longer in existence, a tiny arcade on Pearl Street now fully subsumed by the building as part of a ground floor renovation. Although that arcade generated a 3:1 floor area bonus of 2,007 square feet from its 669-square-foot size, the building as actually built not only did not utilize that bonus floor area but had enough of a zoning floor area cushion that it could actually increase its total built floor area by the 669 square feet, created by enclosing the arcade into the building square footage, without exceeding the maximum allowable zoning floor area for the lot. Thus, the arcade legally changed its identity from required privately owned public space to private space.\nThe plaza’s situation on Hanover Square faces an historic part of the city. The square itself was the location of the city’s first printing press, established in 1692 by the Philadelphia printer William Bradford at 81 Pearl Street, as well as the home in the late 1600s to the pirate Captain Kidd, who was later hanged in England. The nearby statue is of Abraham de Peyster, the city’s mayor from 1691 to 1695. Between 1851 and 1854, the ornate Italianate-style India House was completed to provide space for a bank, and was subsequently used for a cotton exchange, a corporation, and a private club.\nAt a recent site visit, the plaza appeared to be under construction scaffolding.\n"

            "details": "Although this residential plaza surrounds the three street sides of the building, on East 22nd Street, the east side of Broadway, and East 23rd Street, the primary space is on East 22nd Street east of Broadway. Here, the residential plaza employs the familiar two-zone design that physically separates the “public” from the “residential entrance” area. Planters with sittable ledges along the public sidewalk are breached twice: once for a narrow corridor leading to the lobby, once for a wider corridor leading to the deep, rectangular space notched out of the building’s southeast corner. In the eyes of public space law, however, both corridors are equally public. The round forecourt with sittable ledges under the glass canopy in front of the lobby may read like an outdoor lobby for the building, but it is also to be used by members of the public.\nThe part of the plaza that reads as more public is a large space enclosed on west and north ends by the building. Landscaping lines the sides, most interestingly to the east where something called a “landscape sculpture,” composed of multiple levels of brick terraces interspersed with trees, resembles a waterfall without water and provides ambitious climbers with an opportunity to elevate themselves to a private spot. The remainder of space along Broadway and East 23rd Street is extra sidewalk in front of retail stores.\n"

Next to the subway entrance near Broadway are five planters surrounded with high-backed, wooden benches that are heavily used. Four distinctive black cylinders adjacent to the planters may look like a modern-day Stonehenge, but presumably serve an underground mechanical system. Although the café activated the southwest corner of West 53rd Street and Seventh Avenue, its walls and windows made it more of a permanent fixture than what was authorized by the zoning. Furthermore, the café certification expired in 1997 and no record of City re-certification has been found that would permit continuation of the café use.\nA small, enclosed building bumpout occupied by a restaurant protrudes into the southernmost portion of the Seventh Avenue plaza. No record of City approval for this encroachment has been found.\n"

The driveway on East 82nd Street substitutes three bollards for the otherwise ubiquitous fountain and pool in the half circle.

            "details": "Historically, this through block plaza roughly 200 feet east of Sixth Avenue connecting West 45th and 46th Streets has enjoyed one of the highest rates of use of any outdoor public space in the city. Its popularity is easy to explain. When a space offers abundant seating, accessible water features, quality landscaping, a choice between sun and shade, and a variety of public and semi-public zones, and when management carefully maintains the space, then there is a strong likelihood that the public will use it. It should be noted that, at the time of this writing, a proposal from the owners is in the works to modify the space.\n\nOutside the sidewalk entrances, street trees and distinctive sidewalk paving signal that something different is about to occur. The frontage is largely occupied by metal fences, trees, and planter ledges that slope downward and prevent seating, so the pedestrian is drawn into the space simply to discover what the fuss is all about. Access is provided from the sidewalk up two steps from West 45th Street and eight steps from West 46th Street, or from an arcade west of the space.\nLike many through-block spaces, functions of circulation and destination are both well-served here. For circulation, the arcade provides a covered connection, while the through block plaza’s eastern side provides an open-air alternative. For destination-oriented users, the spaces offer much more. People occupy movable dark-green wire mesh chairs that dutifully line the open corridor’s western edge and continue obediently along the rectangular sides of a quiet, shady sub-area next to the West 45th Street entry. Yet something is amiss. These must be the best-behaved public space users in the city, the movable chairs are in fact not movable, or, as proves the case, management prohibits users from moving the movable chairs. This provokes the only common user complaint: “They’re very restrictive. You can only turn your chair one way, you can’t turn it the other way. . . . If you turn your chair, the guy comes up and says, no you can’t take your chair from here and put it over there. He says that’s the rule.” Asked about the rule, the guard explains that it makes it simpler for management to count the chairs. The special permit authorizing the through block plaza requires 133 movable chairs. The animating idea of a movable chair is that it allows the user to create his or her own social environment, rather than compromising that environment to the fixed location of a chair. Although management may impose reasonable rules of conduct in privately owned public spaces, such rules should not undermine the fundamental nature and extent of a required amenity, raising an interesting question in this case.\nNot all of the through block plaza is regimented. The area surrounding the square brick water fountain and pool attracts slightly raucous, densely packed crowds that bask in the sunshine as they eat and socialize. A black aluminum abstract sculpture, entitled Throwback (1976-1979), by Tony Smith, appears to float on the water. The surrounding ledge is barely sittable, especially for women wearing skirts, warns one female user, but other ledges are higher and better. Several additional areas offer different user experiences. A narrow channel of water meanders north under and next to the arcade, ultimately connecting to a small pool and waterfall where greater solitude may be found. Closer to West 46th Street is a miniature forest of trees, a reminder that the host office tower used to be the headquarters for the International Paper Company and this “forest” literally advertised its business. The lunchtime concerts previously sponsored by International Paper are missed. At a recent site visit, the open air café that at one time operated at the eastern side was similarly absent, but the special permit requires a food concession. No record of City approval for this absence has been found. A ribbon of plaza that is no more than additional sidewalk wraps around the rest of the building along Sixth Avenue and West 45th and 46th Streets.\n"

            "details": "At this and several other downtown office buildings, the relationship of size between arcade and plaza is turned on its head: arcades equal, or even exceed, to the point of doubling, the plaza size. The explanation frequently revolves around the lot sizes and shapes in the downtown, forcing developers in some cases to cover as much of the lot with building as possible, at least at the upper floors. Unlike the plaza, an arcade will only diminish the size of the lobby, allowing rentable space to be built above.\n\nHere, the U-shaped arcade wrapping underneath the building on Old Slip, Front Street, and Gouverneur Lane frontages is almost twice the size of the adjacent urban plaza. The arcade wears its size well. Height and width are generous, the skylights placed at the four corners secure natural light, and the carefully cut polished granite columns are of a piece with the building’s cladding. But for the location of a City fire station on the South Street side of the building, this may have been a 360-degree wrap-around arcade like the one at Goldman Sachs.\nBetween South and Front Streets next to Gouverneur Lane is a linear urban plaza with a highly regimented pattern of polished granite slab benches that, although immovable, work surprisingly well for users. Not only do all of the benches have backs, but they are grouped in ways that allow people to socialize in large or small groups, or not socialize at all. While movable chairs and benches are ideal for accommodating the infinite social patterns of plaza users, this fixed array surmounts to an unusual degree its inherent limitation. With its decorative paving, trees growing out of flush-to-the-paving grates, antique-style lamps, and periodic sunlight, the space can be quite pleasant. The East River and docks of Brooklyn appear from beneath the F.D.R. Drive to the east. The sidewalk widening expands the pedestrian way along Front Street.\nUnder the terms of a City Planning Commission special permit, the owner agreed to create a strip of “piazza” within the street bed of Old Slip west of the building, with benches, trees, a fountain, and litter receptacles. Since this piazza is on City-owned land, however, it is legally not a privately owned public space.\n"

            "details": "It would be an understandable mistake to think that this covered plaza, on the west side of Broadway between West 67th and 68th Streets, is all restaurant and no public space. Three large signs on the exterior trumpet the name “Ollie’s,” another sign identifies Ollie’s as a “Noodle Shop & Grille,” and the public space identification sign on glass entry doors in comparison fades into obscurity. Inside the glass panels and doors lining the public sidewalk is more confirmation of a restaurant. People are buying and eating takeout from the large food counter at back, seated around small tables in numerous molded white chairs near a large ice cream cone-shaped structure. A corridor at the southern edge of the space leads, in fact, to a restaurant to the west. Given the powerful image of private food services here, it bears emphasizing that this is public space, and no one is obligated to purchase or do anything. Understood as such, the food service becomes a pleasant amenity that may add to the enjoyment of neighborhood users and passersby. Beyond the northern end of the space, behind a wall covered with plants, is the entry corridor for residents of the Bel Canto, the host building.\nOf the four covered plazas encouraged by the Special Lincoln Square District zoning, this is the only one devoted to food. The covered plaza at 2 Lincoln Square houses a museum, the One Harkness Plaza/Harmony Atrium space supplies a climbing wall, and the tiny outdoor covered plaza at 30 Lincoln Plaza leads to a superb landscaped plaza.\n"

            "details": "The relationship between this office building and a major portion of its public space diverges from the Corbusian “tower in the park” archetype. Unlike the plaza at 140 Broadway across the street, this special permit plaza stands alone, a full-block rectangular park bounded by Broadway, Cedar Street, Trinity Place, and Liberty Street, liberated from its host office tower by Liberty Street. The difference this makes is most keenly understood visually. Whereas 140 Broadway gains its architectural clarity by rising straight and uninterrupted from the middle of its capacious grade-level plaza, One Liberty Plaza does not rely on its disconnected plaza for visual definition.\n\nCalled Liberty Park, the special permit plaza slopes downward from Broadway to Trinity Place. Its linear geometry, tightly regimented rows of mature trees protected at their roots by square metal grates, and ubiquitous stone paving are more redolent of urban than naturalistic landscapes. Eight metal benches are regularly used by passersby, especially when the weather is hot and the shade of the trees entices. On closer examination, one of the bench occupants is revealed to be a bronze sculpture, entitled Double Check, by J. Seward Johnson, Jr., an artist who specializes in bronze life-size sculptures installed in public places. Judging from the startled reaction of plaza users, the sculpture could be entitled Double Take.\nAn elevated ribbon of plaza encircles the full-block host building, above Broadway and Liberty, Church, and Cortlandt Streets. Numerous stairwells and planters provide informal seating opportunities, especially along Cortlandt Street. Access to the subway is provided at the intersection of Church and Cortlandt Streets.\n"

            "details": "Sited diagonally on a through-block parcel fronting East 53rd and 54th Streets between Sutton Place South and First Avenue, this residential tower generates three distinct areas of residential plaza, two of which offer contrasting, but equally pleasant environments. The capacious, brick-paved triangle west of the building’s East 54th Street frontage produces a welcome sensation of openness on a side street otherwise characterized by dense residential fabric. The public sidewalk and plaza flow seamlessly into one another, employing the same paving, trees, and grade level. This effectively enlarges the plaza by the size of the public sidewalk.\nThe space unfolds to the south, with west and east sides converging at a false horizon point at the back. The massing of buildings at off-site locations is thankfully sympathetic, assuring that sunlight reaches the plaza at various times during the day. The western edge is settled by a tall wall, a foreground planter filled with trees, shrubs, and flowers, and a lineup of six wooden garden benches. The vertical presentation of landscaping is well done, with greenery skillfully arrayed at tree canopy, under-story, and ground levels. The eastern edge is formed by the edge of the building and its nonrequired arcade. In the middle of the space, but without the dominating impact associated with artwork located at other public spaces, is an unidentified sculpture fabricated from three black metal vertical strips. What does dominate here is the openness, perfect for the wide variety of users ranging from parents and other caregivers with babies to teenage skateboarders and skaters seeking the wide-open range. Building residents use the space. Indeed, as with many of the better plaza designs, the location of the tower’s primary entrance assures that residents, as well as members of the public, will at least walk through the space, and such common “ownership” by private and public interests helps assure higher-quality maintenance and less of an “us versus them” attitude.\nThe second area of residential plaza wisely provides a different experience. Located east of the tower and its arcaded drop-off driveway, this landscaped terrace is designed for quieter activities of reading and relaxing. The space is almost completely overlaid with tree-and flower-filled planters, making the remaining usable space all the more valuable. Nestled between two planters at back are three benches, isolated, it would seem, from everything but a person’s own thoughts. The background noise of the driveway fountain is soothing, the planting fragrance delightful. If there is no room here, and the contrasting openness to the west is not preferred, then the St. James Tower residential plaza directly across East 54th Street furnishes a similar, if less intimate, landscaped setting.\nThe third and final area of residential plaza, located on East 53 rd Street at the back of the tower, comes closest to leftover space. Planters, trees, and sittable ledges do not automatically create a pleasing physical environment. To get from here to the better portions on East 54th Street is not easy, however. Although the spaces are physically connected by way of arcades under east and west sides of the tower, they are not legally connected because the arcades are not part of the public space network. Thus, the pedestrian theoretically would need permission from the owner to traverse its private arcades. In the early 1990s, the City and owner engaged in litigation over how this residential plaza had been provided. The case was eventually settled and the result has been an important neighborhood asset.\n"

Located on East 64th Street four steps above the sidewalk, the primary space is pleasantly enclosed by low-rise structures on west and east sides. Well-tailored shrubs are arrayed in a deconstructed circle in the middle, complemented by an outer group of planters whose ledges were, at a recent site visit, mostly adorned with spikes. The four wooden benches that used to occupy the eastern side of the space were also missing, and the paucity of usable amenities has taken its toll on public use. In addition to removal of the spikes, some movable tables and chairs would make an enormous difference. The usable residual space on East 65th Street is little more than extra sidewalk in front of the building lobby. The piazza-like space east of the building, with its glass pyramid reminiscent of I.M. Pei’s structure at the Louvre, is not part of the public space.\n"

            "details": "With its pastel pinks, ornamental lions, and formal colonnade, this small, downward-sloping, rectangular urban plaza 125 feet east of Fifth Avenue on the north side of East 39th Street is easily dated to post-modernism’s architectural heyday in the 1980s. On its western side is the colonnade, its seven partly tapered columns supporting a stone beam and glass cover that extend to the building. Like some entrance corridors at public spaces, this one gives the impression of being a private entrance solely for building occupants, but in fact it is part of the public space proper. At recent site visits, tiny planters in the interstices between the colonnade columns appear to have replaced a required bubbler fountain. No record of City approval for its removal has been found.\nHigh northern and eastern walls create a strong, even heavy-handed, sense of enclosure, but inventive decoration at lower wall levels keeps the eye engaged. Green lattice screens, triangular tops, and lion’s faces emitting water into small pools embellish the walls. The lions are a reminder of their full-bodied counterparts decorating the steps in front of the New York Public Library two blocks north across Fifth Avenue. Four planters along the eastern side furnish trees, shrubs, and groundcover, with ledge seating on their front edges. Users typically move the chairs to the middle of the space, although the three semiprivate cubbyholes between planters are also pleasant spots. At recent site visits, some of the required chairs were absent; a sign improperly stated that the space is closed between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., and the plaque that should specify the name and telephone number of a “maintenance designee” who could be contacted to remedy such oversights was missing. As with the bubbler fountain, no record of City approval for these deficiencies has been found.\nSpaces like this one, ever so slightly off the beaten track, are known to neighborhood regulars but unknown to the tens of thousands of pedestrians walking up and down nearby avenue thoroughfares. Here, the average Fifth Avenue pedestrian has no idea that this space exists, even though it is only steps away. Perhaps public sidewalks along the avenues could be annotated with horizontal plaques notifying individuals of the existence of such side street public spaces. The idea is not so outlandish. After all, private property owners frequently mark the border of their lot and the public sidewalk with a tiny horizontal plaque stating that this is private property. The public space marker could read, for example, “Urban plaza, 40 yards east.” The profile for Trump Plaza suggests an alternative way to notify avenue passersby.\n"

Its vast internal volume, cylindrical elevator core, and antiseptically clean white color scheme are evocative of a hangar for a space vehicle as much as a commercial office building lobby. In previous years, a large American flag hung from the cylindrical elevator core, introducing additional primary colors to the space. No seating or other functional amenities are present. A pedestrian easement along Murray Street is effectively additional sidewalk. Several benches are provided in and near the easement.\nThe building currently does not permit public passage into its private lobby, let alone through the lobby and out to Murray Street. At one time, a second-floor elevated walkway running south-to-north through the building from Barclay to Murray Streets was required by the Washington Street Urban Renewal Plan and a City Planning Commission special permit. Initially prepared in 1961, the Plan viewed development on this lot as one part of a larger project and wanted to ensure an intelligent pedestrian circulation system. To that end, the Plan called for pedestrian bridges spanning Murray Street and Barclay Street, and an elevated pedestrian walkway, envisioned as a second-floor loggia in the building, between the two. Over time, however, the Plan was amended and requirements for the two over-street bridges were dropped. Although the owner of 101 Barclay Street previously applied for permission to substitute a street-level pedestrian easement through its lobby from Barclay to Murray Streets for the second-floor loggia, that application was withdrawn by the owner. Thus, the legal status of the interior elevated pedestrian walkway has never been fully resolved, and future discussions between the City and owner are anticipated.\n"

            "details": "Pedestrians may be excused for walking past this residential plaza on the south side of East 72nd Street between York and First Avenues. Much of the street frontage is occupied by inaccessible visual residual space, with a granite wall and metal railing at the lot line and plentiful landscaping of ivy, shrubs, and small trees beyond. The only accessible space, the primary space, is located behind metal gates and brick columns and mainly serves as a glass-canopied entry corridor for the building. For members of the public, the salient functional amenity is the polished granite ledge seating that flanks the entry corridor on both sides. The adjacent western wall could benefit from landscaping cover or artwork to improve its appearance.\n\nThe Zoning Resolution generally discourages “northern plazas” – plazas that face north – because they inherently lack the sunlight received by plazas with southern, eastern, or western exposures. If a zoning lot has frontage with southern, eastern, or western exposure, then it must normally locate the primary space of its residential plaza on that frontage unless the City Planning Commission waives or modifies the requirement. How, then, did this residential plaza locate itself on the zoning lot’s northern exposure when the building sits on a through-block zoning lot with southern exposure frontage on East 71st Street? The answer is that this zoning lot is a split zoning lot, meaning that it is controlled by two zoning districts. Although the R10 zoning district controlling the northern half of the lot allows residential plazas, the R8 district governing the southern half does not. Thus, the owner was not able to place its residential plaza on its southern exposure. Ironically, once an owner is allowed to provide a northern plaza, then the Zoning Resolution is more lenient in terms of required seating and additional amenities than it is for regular residential plazas. After all, the reasoning goes, fewer people will want to sit in a plaza without sunlight.\n"

            "details": "The first thing to know about Park Avenue Plaza is that it is not located on Park Avenue. Its valuable address makes sense, however, by operation of zoning rules permitting a “merger” of its zoning lot with that underneath the venerable Racquet & Tennis Club building to the east, a structure that indisputably fronts Park Avenue. The second thing to know about Park Avenue Plaza is that it has no plaza. The third thing to know about Park Avenue Plaza is that its through block arcade is more functionally and visually akin to a through-block covered pedestrian space as conceived by the Zoning Resolution. Although it does connect East 52nd and 53rd Streets between Park and Madison Avenues, its primary purpose is to encourage people to stay for substantial periods of time rather than pass through or stop for a moment.\nA potential explanation for the space’s schizophrenia is revealed by its history. The owner originally proposed to provide a public galleria, once defined in the Zoning Resolution as a “continuous covered public space” that is “occupied by multiple uses such as restaurants, boutiques, and specialty stores,” that “at its roof level incorporates skylight areas of not less than 20 percent to allow the access of direct sunlight,” and that “is landscaped with elements, such as trees, flowerbeds, movable furniture, sitting areas, escalators, public toilets, drinking fountains, adequate lighting, water features, displays, works of art, cafés and kiosks. . . .” When the owner determined that its office skyscraper no longer required the extra floor area generated by the bonus rate for a public galleria, it legally switched to a through block arcade while retaining much of the public galleria design and amenities. The result is an elegant, two-story, glass-enclosed indoor space heavily used by an unusually wide spectrum of New Yorkers.\nFrom the outside looking in through the green-tinted glass on East 52nd and 53rd Streets, the climate-controlled space looks enticing in summer and winter. To the east of both entrances are defined seating areas cushioned by small groves of mature ficus trees, green shrubbery, and flowers. Movable tables and chairs are occupied by persons of diverse social and economic backgrounds. Chess games are a regular activity. An occasional bird flies above.\nSandwiched between these two passive activity alcoves is an eating area buffered on its three open sides by two kiosks and a narrow ledge. The food kiosk offers breakfast and lunch, consumed by patrons at rows of café tables and chairs. The admonition on a sign states, “All seating available to public and no purchase of food or beverage required.” Next to the café seating on the eastern wall is a slick two-story, black stone-backed waterfall covered by a skylight. The sound of cascading water modulates the otherwise hard acoustics of this space. The piano music further softens the atmosphere.\nAlthough not legally part of the public space, the adjacent retail shopping arcade past the elevators to the west is worth visiting. Its design is vaguely reminiscent of European shopping arcades, and features outsized glass storefronts for each business. The two public restrooms are located next to the elevators.\n"

            "details": "This through-block park connecting East 87th and 88th Streets is located 200 feet east of Third Avenue, in front of the entrance to the building. The space is called a park because the owner received a variance from the Board of Standards and Appeals and committed itself to constructing a space meeting requirements higher than those demanded under the 1961 Zoning Resolution’s “as-of-right” plaza provisions.\nThe park is divided into three areas. Up five steps from East 87th Street is an open area with surrounding brick and stone ledge seating that presents metal spikes on some, but not all, seating surfaces. The flagstone-paved middle terrace up another four steps features a large L-shaped pool to the east. It is here that several subtle design gestures, such as the elevated flagstone terrace and the rusticated stone sides of seating ledges, momentarily recall qualities associated with older park designs. The facades of the low-rise buildings south across East 87th Street transport the park user to an older city, if only for a moment. The park space near East 88th Street is surrounded by more ledge seating. Landscaping has been taken seriously here; in the past name tags have identified the trees. Next to the residential building is a partly covered through-block driveway that qualifies at its street entrances as plaza.\n"

            "details": "This formal residential plaza sits in front of its host building, on the north side of East 60th Street some 75 feet east of Second Avenue. Although the presence of Queensboro Bridge ramp traffic across the street is felt, the space successfully buffers the commotion with effective screening of trees, planter wall, and fence on the southern perimeter. The screen also has the effect, however, of making the space less visible to passersby. Indeed, to obtain entry, members of the public as well as residents must walk through an elaborate postmodern pavilion, composed of black columns, notched-brick pediment, triangular glass canopy, and pyramidal red cap, at the western edge and be buzzed in through a locked gate. Individuals unknown to the doorman must identify themselves via intercom which, at a recent site visit, elicited no buzz and a response that the space was private. No record of City approval has been found for the gate or the statement that the space is private.\nThe plaza adopts the two-zone residential plaza model of designated lobby approach zone and usable space zone, although the two here are happily porous to one another. Building residents normally proceed north under the glass canopy to their front door, but their path is neither visually nor physically obstructed from the usable space to the east. Members of the public would veer east, although they could walk to the front door if they wanted to do so. Given this visual and physical transparency, it is not surprising that the plaza presents high-quality materials and well-maintained conditions suggestive of the solicitude of management. Polished black-granite planter walls and ledges invite seating as they undulate along the eastern edge and surround a free-standing small planter. Well-manicured shrubs, trees, and flowers monopolize the planters, except for a whimsical, triangular red cover over the black mechanical vent.\n"

            "details": "Of the three through-block passages linking West 56th and 57th Streets between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, this indoor through block connection is the most logical choice for pedestrians seeking to walk to or from part or all of the mid-block chain running from West 51st to 57th Streets. From a location point of view, this passageway is most closely aligned with the through block connection at CitySpire directly south. It also features a sunny, functional urban plaza on West 56th Street, with four square detached brick planters and attached wall planters offering plentiful ledge seating, and a retail food service outlet for refreshment. The minimalist black metal-and-glass canopy toward the west leads to a private entrance that has nothing to do with the through block connection. Entry to the connection is more centrally placed off the urban plaza and serves not only as a through path for passing pedestrians, but as the entrance for office tenants and visitors of the building. From a zoning point of view, the urban plaza holds additional interest, since it does double duty as both bonused “urban plaza” and required “through block connection” satisfying the building’s “pedestrian circulation space” requirement under the Special Midtown District’s zoning standards. By tracing a legally mapped corridor between the four square planters from West 56th Street to the entrance of the interior portion of the through block corridor, it is possible to imagine the full legal extent, including an exterior portion, of the through block connection here.\nWhy are there three parallel through-block passageways on the same one-block stretch? Surely the foot traffic between West 56th and 57th Streets in the vicinity of Sixth and Seventh Avenues does not call for such a surplus of choice. The Zoning Resolution did not mandate the provision of all three, since the through block arcade at Le Parker Meridien Hotel to the east is the product of a floor area bonus voluntarily sought and received by the developer in 1979. However, the through block connections here and at Carnegie Hall Tower to the west were provided to satisfy pedestrian circulation space requirements announced by the Special Midtown District zoning. At the time of their provision, the Special Midtown District did not require the provision of a third through block connection where two already existed on the same block, but it also did not disqualify the provision of a third for satisfying the pedestrian circulation space criteria. An amendment to the Special Midtown District zoning now prevents a developer from counting a through block connection as pedestrian circulation space if there are already two through block connections. But even if such amendment had existed when Carnegie Hall Tower’s through block connection was proposed, the question remains whether Le Parker Meridien Hotel’s through block arcade would be counted as a through block connection for this purpose. From West 51st Street to here, the other spaces in the six-block chain include the through block gallerias at PaineWebber, Flatotel, and 1325 Avenue of the Americas, and the through block connections at Rihga Royal Hotel and CitySpire.\n"

At a recent site visit, some of the plaza and arcade space on Lexington Avenue was rendered off-limits, hidden behind construction scaffolding, and it will be interesting to see what emerges.\n"

Without the interruption caused by the two low-rise buildings at the northeast corner of East 55th Street and Third Avenue, the plaza would be configured in the ubiquitous U-shaped form, clamped onto the building’s street frontage along the east side of Third Avenue and the side streets of East 55th and 56th Streets. The presence of the two-story building at the corner suggests the possibility of a “holdout” scenario, where the low-rise owner may have declined to sell, or sell at the right price, to the 919 Third Avenue developer. In any event, the developer built next to it and surrounded it with public space.\nThe plaza has recently undergone a renovation. The bright white surface that contrasted smartly with the black glass of the office tower has been toned down with new material. On East 56th Street, a rectangular planter lines the sidewalk edge with ledges that are not sittable. At a recent site visit, the East 55th Street side was still under construction.\n"

Behind a sidewalk perimeter of tall black-metal fences and accessible down narrow gated pathways from East 70th or 71st Streets, the sheer expanse of ground cover is visually impressive, with waves of ivy and shrubs breaking eastward toward the building.\nUnlike heavily landscaped “as-of-right” plazas that pose the question whether green hegemonies are consistent with the spirit, if not the letter, of the zoning requirement that the space be open and accessible to the public at all times (see, for example, the Churchill plaza), the provision and design of this parklike open space was a condition of a variance granted by the City’s Board of Standards and Appeals and thus was not subject to the “as-of-right” rules whatsoever. However, a small part of the open space west of the building is legally classified as “as-of-right” plaza rather than park-like open space, a distinction shown on the site plan but virtually impossible to discern on site. The plaza area and a slice of the park-like open space furnish seven fixed, backless, wooden benches, distributed into three small seating areas on the southern half of the through-block space. When the sun is out and the light sparkles on the ivy leaves, the field positively comes alive.\nMore park-like open space is located east of the residential tower next to the variance arcade and its through-block driveway. The only access to the space is via the arcade and driveway, although signs at both ends announce that this is a private entrance and thoroughfare. Unlike its western counterpart, the style here is less natural and more formal. A square fountain with three bubbling jets and brown moss-covered stone base provides ledge seating. Two disk-shaped benches and two rectangular benches are nearby. At north and south ends are nooks with more disk-shaped and rectangular benches. Planters with pleasant landscaping border the space to the east. The rest of the space is landscaped area in front of the building’s street sides.\n"

A café has set up movable white plastic tables and chairs on artificial green turf behind planters and low-slung walls topped with spiked metal railings. Previous discussions between the owner and the City led to an agreement requiring the owner to install three signs at the base of the planters announcing that the public may use the chairs and tables at all times without obligation to purchase anything.\nRecent site visits revealed two plaques, largely hidden behind tables and chairs, containing the words “Public Plaza Open To Public 9am To Sunset,” but none of the required signs. The brightly colored café sign advertising “Happy Hour” margaritas, pina coladas, and dacquiris is surely cheerier, but it is worth emphasizing that this is a 24-hour-a-day space, that members of the public should feel literally, spiritually, and pecuniarily free to sit at the chairs and tables, and that signs should state that fact. The depressed space on East 34th Street has a wall that in years past would have attracted a fierce game of handball.\n"

On East 38th Street east of the Midtown Tunnel Access Road, the entrance at street level is celebrated by a small, beige-brick and white-granite fountain suggestive of the Italian Renaissance by its design and decaying façade. When it is working, the fountain emits water from the sculptural face of a lion into a basin surrounded by a curving white granite ledge.\nThe decorative fountain heightens user anticipation for the space beyond. Curving stairs to the left and right of the fountain ascend six steps and converge in front of a metal gate posted with a sign informing the user, “Courtyard open from 10 A.M. – 7 P.M. daily. No dogs allowed. Thank you.” At a recent site visit, the gate was locked at 4:00 p.m. No record of City approval has been found to support the installation of gates or the imposition of restricted hours of access. Past the gate and up another six steps is a large, open, concrete courtyard bordered by a variety of buildings. Interesting city vistas emerge between buildings, and the space does receive sunlight, but there is little to do here. A rectangular water pool with sculpture and unsittable slanted ledge occupies the middle.\n"

            "details": "Unlike some Upper East Side residential plazas that use high planters to create internalized, isolated space away from the street, or that separate the residential entrance from the rest of the space, this rectangular brick residential plaza at the southeast corner of First Avenue and East 84th Street is content to open itself up to full scrutiny from everyone. Although planters line much of its perimeter, they are low and thus do not create any visual barrier to the space. Curved ledge seating along the well-manicured planters is available in various configurations at east and west ends, disappointing only because tiny vertical stone slabs subdivide the ledge into individual units. Indeed, the only ledge without the dividers has a railing that fully prevents seating. Is it really necessary to stop individuals from slouching or lying down at this space?\nIf outsiders are generally welcomed by design, insiders are pleasantly integrated as well. The entrance to the building is in the middle of the primary space, and the capacious pathway is not covered by a long canopy or otherwise distinguished by segregating structure or planters. By placing the lobby entrance right in the middle, the doorman can see and be seen, providing a sense of security and care that is evident in the high levels of maintenance here. At the eastern end of the space behind a gate is visual residual space, with more landscaping and a pathway not legally required to be accessible to the public. Nonetheless, a restaurant and outdoor seating entice the user to enter.\n"

The semicircular drop-off driveway space, located on East 75th Street next to Second Avenue, features a fountain with six jets and a porte cochere at the front door. An arcade sits at the building entrance. A polished metal sculpture with two upright elements stands in the middle of the planted area near Second Avenue. Extra sidewalk space extends south along Second Avenue almost to East 74th Street. Four benches are located nearer to East 75th Street.\nAlso like 300 East 74th Street, there is a usable space in back, on the north side of East 74th Street east of Second Avenue. Here, although some of this space received a floor area bonus, the owner promised the 4,000-square-foot landscaped park as part of its application to the Board of Standards and Appeals for a variance granted in 1977. Six steps above the sidewalk and behind a metal gate, the rectangular area is comfortably uncluttered, benefited by the absence of tall buildings east and west that permits sunlight to brighten the brick pavement. Planters generously filled with trees, shrubs, and ground cover line side and rear edges. Seven backless, fixed wooden benches are located in the various nooks created by the angling of the planter wall and ledges. A fenced-off pathway to the back of the building on the western side has a small gate to the space that is usually locked.\n"

            "details": "The primary portion of this slightly raised plaza sits in front of the building’s two street sides, on the east side of Broad and the north side of South Streets. Entryways at far ends of the plaza and at the Broad and South intersection provide the only access points. The Broad Street entry serves members of the public and building tenants equally, although each group quickly peels off onto its respective path. Thus, tenants head straight down the canopied glass corridor to the arcade and main entrance, while the public veers south into the rectangular open area between the arcade and a street-side waterfall. The geometry of the expanse leads the eye beyond to the East River. Combined with the whiteness of the building skin and stone plaza surface, it is as if the design were paying slight homage to Louis Kahn’s brilliant engagement of the Pacific Ocean in his Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. If the whiteness of the plaza and building surfaces becomes too harsh on sunny days, the waterfall that cascades down a slanted wall into a natural stone pool, bordered by sittable ledges with planters, provides the perfect foil.\nMore plaza unfolds at a 90-degree angle parallel to South Street, revealing spectacular views of the East River and the Brooklyn Bridge. A border of planters with mature trees and sittable ledges encloses the space, and café tables and chairs are sprinkled in the middle.\nA sliver of plaza and fragment of arcade are found on the east side of the building, adjacent to the Vietnam Veterans Plaza and the plaza at 55 Water Street, with slight frontage along South Street for access.\n"

On Third Avenue, concrete planters with bushes separate the public sidewalk from the interior plaza strip and the building’s retail frontage. A block-long elevation change is managed by a series of steps. In response to a Department of City Planning mailing in 1988, the owner’s representative asserted by letter that “it would be ridiculous to encourage the use of this space.” Spiked railings applied to planter ledges here and on the side street planter ledges testify to this sensibility. When railings are missing, as they have been from time to time, passersby find the gap and enjoy the moment. An abstract metal sculpture creates interest near the lobby entrance on East 65th Street.\n"

Waterfalls and overflowing landscapes evoke the image of a Babylonian hanging garden. Near the tower entrance on the upper plaza level is the water’s source, a geyser shooting out of the plaza floor. More water pours from an elevated trough emerging from a lush jungle of hanging ivy, shrubs, trees, and colorful flowers. The water tumbles down a stepped brick wall before settling into a lower basin fed by another trough. The water feature not only masks the street noise and cools the air, but it aligns space and building. Standing in the middle of the lower plaza level near the corner of East 48th Street and United Nations Plaza, for example, the user is visually guided by the line of the waterfall upward to the brass-colored canopy pyramid to the building’s front door.\nThe plaza ranks high on functionality as well as aesthetic appeal, offering exposed and secluded areas for traditional public space activities such as eating, reading, and relaxing. The lower level is more public, with a square red-brick open zone surrounded by ledge seating, three brick stools near the basin, and sunny southern exposure. Unfortunately, the water is not physically accessible to the user. The upper-level zone north of the tower entrance is more secluded, appealing principally to building residents but equally available to members of the public. With its plentiful ledge seating, it is worth seeking out even if the approach to it feels increasingly private. The sidewalks along East 48th Street and United Nations Plaza also feature ledge seating. A small, disconnected piece of visual residual residential plaza occupies the setback space in front of 871 United Nations Plaza, a building closer to East 49th Street.\n"

A 15-foot-high bronze sculpture with gray patina, entitled Triad (1969), by Irving Marantz, appears to depict three individuals in a cubist embrace. A book about Manhattan’s outdoor sculpture speculates that the work may be “alluding to the three Cohen brothers, the realtors who commissioned the work” and developed this office building. Another Marantz sculpture may be found two blocks north, at 3 Park Avenue. With the richness of older New York architecture all around this space, it is worth looking upward across the street at the brightly painted façades and remarkable assortment of ornamentation.

            "details": "Located at the northeast corner of First Avenue and East 80th Street, the rectangular primary space of this residential plaza thoughtfully marries three highly valued public space attributes – artwork, seating, and sunlight – to create a popular neighborhood place. Indeed, the plaza so effectively integrates aesthetics and function that it is sometimes difficult to determine where one ends and the other begins.\nTony Rosenthal’s Steel Park (1980) is a collection of abstract colorful painted-metal panels, cylinders, and other cutout shapes vertically arrayed on two black corrugated-metal platforms several inches above the brick plaza surface. The work also serves as a seat back, a wind break, a solar-powered radiator, and a place-marker. Users sitting on metal benches lean against red, orange, blue, and white panels. The varying heights and placements of sculptural elements provide protection from extreme wind. In colder months, according to several regular users, the metal pieces absorb sunlight and turn into heating elements. The black metal sundial sculpture artfully draws attention to the plentiful sunlight bathing this south-facing corner space. The entire work of art converts this piece of neighborhood from a point in a geographic grid to an image etched in the minds of neighboring residents. The marriage of art and function may also be viewed in Scott Burton’s work at the PaineWebber urban plaza and, in a more whimsical vein, at the plaza at 747 Third Avenue.\nAdditional seating is located under a metal pergola at the north side of the space and in front of a planter near the residential building’s through-block driveway to the east. Planters are lushly filled with trees, shrubs, and flowers. The usable residual space extends north along First Avenue in front of retail stores.\n"

If so, that is good news in the long run for public space users. That is because the developer is obligated to complete substantially and open to the public this through-block space, linking West 49th and 50th Streets between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, only when it seeks a temporary certificate of occupancy for up to 75 percent of the new building’s floor area. The developer must fully complete the space prior to issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy. The only cost to the public is short-term, because it will lose the use of Exxon Park, described in the profile for 1251 Sixth Avenue. Although Exxon Park was not a privately owned public space, in the sense that it was never required by zoning to be open and accessible to the public, it had been open through the generosity of its owner and enjoyed a loyal following. An underground passageway providing subway access is also required.\n"

As it descends from Broadway to New Street, for example, on the north side of Exchange Place, the linear strip positions five squeezed, parallelogram-shaped polished granite planters, filled with trees, tropical plants, and flowers, along its public sidewalk perimeter. While narrow, the sittable planter ledges are frequently occupied by pedestrians making a brief stop.\nThe strip of plaza on Broadway affords a dramatic view of Trinity Church for those who stop rushing long enough to look up from the pavement. Unfortunately, the lone planter at the northern end has a downward sloping ledge that precludes sitting.\n"

            "details": "Like other publicly and privately owned public spaces in the city, this urban plaza to the west of its host residential tower on the north side of West 48th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue has encountered thorny issues regarding its use by certain members of the public. At a recent site visit, security personnel employed by the Times Square Business Improvement District stated that the plaza has experienced problems with homeless users, who have been asked to vacate the space from time to time.\n\nHow should privately owned public spaces be used by members of the public? In thinking about this question, it is important to recognize that use by some individuals may deter use by others. Not only is this inevitable, but it may even be desirable. For example, some people like crowds, others treasure solitude. Some crave excitement, others seek quiet. When spaces develop a personality, they axiomatically stop being all things to all people and, with more than 500 public spaces in the city, differentiation is to be expected and accepted.\nStill, if everyone need not feel equally at home at every public space at all times, no one should feel effectively uninvited at all times. In general, a bicycle messenger, lawyer, student, traffic officer, caregiver, construction worker, taxi driver, or homeless person should be equally entitled to use a public space as long as his or her conduct does not unreasonably impinge upon the ability of others to use the space. The key concepts are “conduct” and “unreasonably.” With regard to conduct, it is vitally important to distinguish between conduct and identity. The mere identity of a person as homeless, no more than the identity of a person as a construction worker or lawyer, should never disqualify that person from using the space. On the other hand, if that person’s conduct, in the sense of actions taken by that person, becomes such a nuisance to others that they are fully prevented from enjoying the space, then that person may legitimately be asked to cease such conduct or leave the space. Stating the rule in the abstract is, of course, far easier than drawing lines in the field. One individual’s definition of reasonable conduct is another person’s idea of anarchy, but the effort to make reasoned distinctions is essential in societies whose ideals include respect for pluralism and difference.\nThe owner of The Ritz has taken a customary approach to this issue, encouraging greater use of the space during day and evening hours by planning to install open air cafés and closing the space at night. At the time of this writing, the space is planned for a renovation as part of its nighttime closing arrangements. Thus, the four brick planters and wooden benches may become amenities of the past, and the user profile may change.\n"

The corollary space on East 48th Street does not have benches.\nThe through-block space at the back of the building presents itself as a driveway, with signs describing the area as “private” and chains and planters bolstering the message. According to past statements from the owner, the plaza here is used for parking by United States Secret Service personnel, perhaps when they are escorting government figures to and from the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to the north across East 49th Street. At a recent site visit, a number of sports utility vehicles of unknown ownership were parked in the plaza. No record of City approval for any of these uses has been found.\n"

            "details": "Since this full-block office building covers almost the entire zoning lot, its 13,000 square feet of plaza is necessarily extruded into a long ribbon wrapping around its four sides on Hudson, West Houston, Greenwich, and King Streets. As such, the space functions as an extension of the public sidewalk. At a recent site visit, several café chairs were placed in the plaza outside a food outlet and next to the outdoor arcade on West Houston Street. No record of City approval for the chairs has been found.\nTwo Frank Stella artworks on north and south sides of the private lobby off Hudson Street are vaguely visible from the plaza and sidewalk. It is interesting to contrast their placement in this lobby with the placement of another Stella in the private lobby at 599 Lexington Avenue. That Stella boldly engages pedestrians in the public space outside the building as well as those who enter the lobby.\n"

            "details": "Public art and public spaces are constant collaborators in the city. For the art, a public space can serve as an ideal exhibition platform, drawing chance and committed observers alike on a daily basis. For the space, public art can provide an instant identity, supplying an inherently unique element to what is often a standard presentation of amenities. In examining the collaboration between public space and public art, the question of context is unusually important. Does the artwork advance an understanding of the space? Does the space contribute to an understanding of the art? Are the two arbitrarily placed in juxtaposition? Does the juxtaposition actually harm one or the other?\nA 1990s addition to this urban plaza, a small rectangular space in a notched area of the building on the north side of East 53rd Street west of Madison Avenue, dramatically poses such questions. Five large reinforced concrete slabs taken from the demolished Berlin Wall, literally pieces of history, have been planted upright near the western edge of the space. Inscribed with garish, colored images of grim faces and graffiti, the slabs powerfully convey the sense of desolation and alienation presumably felt by those divided by the wall. The work is known as The Berlin Wall, created by artists Thierry Noir and Kiddy Citny, and falls squarely within a venerable public art tradition of jolting viewers out of their routine ways of thinking.\nDoes this art work well at this public space, however? As installed, the concrete slabs essentially take it over. The Berlin Wall now, ironically, separates the urban plaza from its most salient, valuable amenity, a four-paneled water wall and reflecting pool lining the western edge. The naturalistic ambience of nine loosely arrayed trees and cobblestone paving, reminiscent of nearby, tranquil Paley Park, seems at odds with the in-your-face history lesson. Placed in close quarters with movable white wire-mesh café chairs and tables, heavily used for lunchtime eating, the slabs may lessen the prosaic pleasures of lunch or be trivialized by the activities of public space users. Perhaps the owner of the building viewed these slabs as an outdoor extension of artwork it has showcased for many years in its adjacent private office lobby.\nThe other public space here is sidewalk widening that virtually encircles the building on East 53rd Street, the west side of Madison Avenue, and the south side of East 54th Street. At a recent site visit, an open air café had installed tables and chairs on East 54th Street. No record of City approval has been found.\n"

            "details": "Located between Dey and Fulton Streets on Church Street, across from the huge plaza in front of the World Trade Center’s twin towers, this modest urban plaza furnishes uncovered and covered areas for seating. Near Fulton Street is an enclave of four round polished black-granite planters set in decorative paving, each with a tree and each encircled by comfortable ledge seating and metal rails that, refreshingly, serve as seat backs rather than seat impediments. The openness of the graveyard across Fulton Street, behind Saint Paul’s Chapel, offsets the tightness of the space and the irrefutable presence of the World Trade Center. At night the trees are lit and the tiny place takes on a festive air.\n\nIn service of the hotel, a glass-and-metal canopy structure extends from the lobby doors to the Church Street curb and slices the urban plaza in half. Because the canopied space is not only covered on top, but also enclosed on each side by scored glass walls, it is impossible to walk from south to north ends of the urban plaza without making a detour into the public sidewalk. The compensation, however, is a public area protected from the elements with two wood benches for seating. Even though this entryway feels private, exclusively serving the hotel, it is important to realize that it is not. The southern third of the urban plaza has four flagpoles and four planters set near the building. Sidewalk widening space is located on both Fulton and Dey Streets.\nAs for the World Trade Center plaza across the street, it is a publicly owned public space under the jurisdiction of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and thus does not enter the City’s inventory of privately owned public spaces. The space recently underwent a major renovation designed to encourage greater public use, and the early results are encouraging.\n"

            "details": "Four well-coordinated public spaces join forces to invigorate this full blockfront office tower on the east side of Third Avenue between East 52nd and 53rd Streets. An open space occupies the triangular area at the southeast corner of Third Avenue and East 53rd Street. A public circulation space inside the building connects users from the open space to the three-level covered pedestrian space. Miniscule arcade spaces cover the entrances to the covered pedestrian space at the northeast corner of Third Avenue and East 52nd Street and on East 53rd Street east of Third Avenue.\nOf the four, the covered pedestrian space is the main attraction. In some respects, it is similar to the space at the Crystal Pavilion building two blocks south. It operates on three levels, including ground, concourse, and mezzanine levels. It has a three-story open core that is partially enclosed by glass skylight to the northwest. Its ground level serves mostly as a circulation corridor, creating a shortcut from the northeast corner of Third Avenue and East 52nd Street northeast to East 53rd Street while providing access in the middle via criss-crossing bright red-paneled escalators to concourse and mezzanine levels. At the concourse level, eight types of food outlets purvey their wares to large lunchtime crowds seated at the plentiful movable tables and chairs. A flower shop adds color, and a piano stands at the ready. The mezzanine level above surrounds the core and furnishes more tables and chairs.\nThere are a number of differences, however, between this space and the one at Crystal Pavilion that hold important lessons for the planning and design of covered pedestrian spaces. Although this one lacks Crystal Pavilion’s surface sizzle — indeed the red-and-black color scheme seems plain by comparison — it nonetheless hosts a level of activity unseen down the street. The explanations are easy to unearth. To begin with, this covered pedestrian space is not an end in itself. Its street level is activated by the stream of employees and visitors who pass through the space to reach the private elevators of the office tower. The concourse level provides access to the subway, an attraction especially important for sunken spaces, whether inside or outside, that inevitably need something extra to generate the foot traffic. Once there, if there is something else to interest passersby, such as food, they will stop, creating more activity that itself draws others.\nAnother difference between this covered pedestrian space and the one at Crystal Pavilion is its street face. Here, the interior space is not cloaked behind a typical office building entry façade that does everything but tell passersby about the existence of something interesting inside. The open space at Third Avenue and East 53rd Street was created in 1990, after several existing low-rise buildings were demolished in a second development phase. By removing these structures, the design initiated a salutary transparency between outdoor and indoor public experiences, influencing pedestrians to pause for a moment at the movable tables and chairs in front of the café, or to enter the interior space visually evident through the glass wall.\nSeveral other amenities are worth citing. The street-level covered pedestrian space and public circulation space have tables, chairs, and adjacent food service; and it is important to note that members of the public may sit without obligation to purchase anything. The café does have its own seating area, however, northeast of the public circulation space, that it may operate as it chooses. Weekly public events at least one hour in length are scheduled. Two public restrooms are located at the eastern end of the concourse level, behind dark glass doors that the guard must open. At least two guards patrol the spaces.\nThe operation of these spaces today stands in contrast to a bumpy early history. In 1983, the City brought a court action against the building owner when it leased out two office floors, representing the bonus floor area for the spaces, prior to completing the spaces as described in the special permit and restrictive declaration. The City and owner were able to settle the dispute.\n"

            "details": "Years ago, this rectangular plaza on the south side of East 40th Street west of the full blockfront residential building on Third Avenue was a barren place, with paving in disrepair, eight of ten planters missing trees, crack vials and old clothes In the planter dirt, no seating, and a cylindrical vent-like structure with graffiti. Now, that vent-like structure is the only link to the past, and the plaza has become a pleasant, usable space.\nThe building to the east and the 10-foot-high brick walls on western and southern sides generate a feeling of enclosure, as if this were a large urban living room. The furniture includes plentiful black café tables and chairs, available for public use without obligation even though the umbrellas on several tables carry the name of the adjacent food service. Planters are filled with flowers and six tall trees. The plaza surface has been repaired. Futuristic-looking stanchion lights provide evening illumination.\nA hypertechnical reading of the plaza regulations from the 1961 Zoning Resolution could be mustered to proscribe the movable tables and chairs, since they are not inscribed in the Resolution’s list of permitted obstructions, a list that expressly includes arbors and trellises, awning and canopies, railings, flagpoles, open terraces and porches, steps, ornamental fountains, statuary, and unenclosed balconies. The City has declined to interpret inflexibly this provision, in the belief that tables and chairs can, as here, render a plaza more usable for members of the public. The installation of a wall and gate along the sidewalk border presents another question under the Zoning Resolution, since it is not authorized as such. At a recent site visit, the gate was locked, although the space is required to be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. No record of City approval has been found. The full blockfront arcade on the west side of Third Avenue provides protection from inclement weather.\n"

Welcome to this residential plaza at the southeast corner of Second Avenue and East 85th Street, a neighborhood hangout and place for dynamic discussion. At any moment, there may be 20 persons, mostly retired, sitting on the ledges of the two T-shaped planters in the primary space on East 85th Street, gossiping, criticizing, consoling, and doing the other things that forge bonds among neighbors and friends in an urban residential environment. Although the space receives most of its sunlight in the morning, it stays popular through the day and into the evening. As one older user summed up, “This space brought a lot of people out . . . [we] used to stay in [our] apartments [and now we may stay here] up to three hours.” The most distinctive physical attribute of the space is the bright red metal sculpture that resembles one of Claes Oldenburg’s oversized clothespins, only slightly deconstructed. The artwork may be enjoyed on its own terms, but it may also be understood in urban design terms as a mnemonic device cueing individuals to remember and appreciate, functionally and psychologically, where they are in the city, without resort to the quantitative geography of the street grid. Meet me at the red clothespin space becomes a preferred way of conveying directions.\nOver time, a place-marker can become even more than an orientation point. It can be transformed from oddity to familiar, even comforting, presence that makes neighboring residents feel at home. When the Eiffel Tower first appeared, Parisians by and large hated it. Now they cannot imagine Paris without it. To be sure, the clothespin is not the Eiffel Tower of New York City or this neighborhood, but in its small way it plays a similar anchoring role. The usable residual space on Second Avenue south of East 85th Street has two rectangular planters with ledge seating that is divided into individual seats by low spiked railings. Visual residual space at the eastern back corner of the building is located behind a closed gate.\n"

            "details": "The development of Trump World Tower has generated more controversy than most buildings in the city. In 1998, developer Donald Trump announced that he was about to develop the world’s tallest residential tower, on the west side of First Avenue between East 47th and 48th Streets. A variety of individuals and civic groups objected, on the grounds that it was too big, too tall, would block views, and was otherwise out-of-scale with the surrounding neighborhood. Some observed that the tower, at 861 feet in height and 72 floors, would dwarf the venerated Secretariat building of the United Nations complex to the southeast and diminish by comparison its stature on the East River.\nTrump was able to develop this building by merging a number of nearby zoning lots containing existing buildings and unused development rights into his zoning lot, thereby producing a total zoning lot of 89,772 square feet. He then concentrated all of the allowable floor area generated by the merged zoning lot onto his original zoning lot abutting First Avenue, producing the substantial size of his residential tower. The residential plaza, whose primary space is located at the northwest corner of First Avenue and East 47th Street, generated only about 40,000 square feet of this 938,000-square-foot building, or less than five percent of its floor area. Under construction at this writing, the building is currently the subject of a legal challenge. Comments on the residential plaza will await its completion.\n"

            "details": "Located slightly east of Broadway on the north side of West 63rd Street, this plaza has received a modest facelift since the late 1980s that demonstrates how even small design changes can result in substantial improvements in usability and attractiveness. Previously, this large space was landscaped with white rocks, pebbles, dirt, and shrubs. If the well-meaning intent was evocation of a Japanese garden, the unfortunate effect was creation of a barren hardscrabble. Today, a luxurious carpet of verdant lawn has replaced the dirt and rocks, while an ornamental fountain, sculpted tree, and solitary stone recall the Japanese motif. In summer, this space, with its three old large-canopied trees, is a shady oasis from the heat of city streets. Seating on the grass is pleasant, although the space could benefit from more comfortable ledges. For example, the wooden retaining-wall ledge that separates the lawn from the rest of the plaza is too low, while the ledge on the perimeter at the public sidewalk is too narrow. Tables, chairs, and benches dotting the space between the lawn and the building, otherwise ideal for seating, appear to belong to the adjacent restaurant whose glass shed juts into the plaza space. No record of City approval has been found for the private use of these tables and chairs, and it is still to be determined how the glass shed occupied part of the space.\nThe full blockfront arcade on Broadway provides a protected route from inclement weather and becomes the northern leg of a two-block Broadway arcade system, along with 30 Lincoln Plaza from West 62nd to 64th Streets. A sliver of plaza is located on West 64th Street east of Broadway.\n"

            "details": "Burnishing its image as a leading arts patron, the Philip Morris Company has devoted much of its glass- and granite-enclosed multistory covered pedestrian space to a successful collaboration with the Whitney Museum of American Art. Located at the southwest corner of Park Avenue and East 42nd Street across from Grand Central Terminal and open seven days a week, the space has displayed sculptures from that museum’s permanent collection since it was completed in 1982. With the Whitney able to exhibit only a small percentage of its collection at any one time, arrangements such as this can benefit space-hungry museums, corporate patrons, and members of the public alike. Indeed, such collaborative efforts are models for cultural institutions seeking new locations and audiences for their exhibits, concert series, dramatic presentations, and similar artistic endeavors, and for privately owned public space owners wondering how they may revitalize their spaces.\n\nThe covered pedestrian space may be entered either from East 42nd Street or Park Avenue under an arcade wrapping around north and east sides of the building. Unlike some designs, this one unapologetically separates the private lobby entrance from the public space entrance, locating the private entrance at the northwest corner of Park Avenue and East 41st Street. The closest that public space users come to that lobby is via a view through windows on the western and southern walls of the space. Despite this separation, there is no evidence whatsoever that the space has been disowned by its host building.\nThe Park Avenue entrance offers the most dramatic entrance, placing the user on a terrace seven steps above the floor and providing a vantage point from which to survey the space, the artworks, and the functional amenities. With its substantial height, narrow width, and gray granite columns, the space could have conveyed an austere formality were it not for its use of generously sized windows on all four walls that cleverly expand the visual boundaries and allow in large amounts of natural daylight. In combination with recessed ceiling lights, the windows guarantee a light and airy atmosphere unusual for most indoor privately owned public spaces. The artwork also humanizes the space. Over the years, sculptures have been scattered about, in close proximity with users, spawning an informal immediacy delightfully at variance with the customary formal museum setting. Long-time visitors may recall George Segal’s buoyant bronze with white patina, called Dancers, of four nude women dancing together, holding hands, in homage to Matisse’s Dance. Also installed was a painted chrome-and-metal work, entitled City Lux, by John Chamberlain, composed of crushed automobile parts. Other standouts from the past have included Jonathan Borofsky’s Man with a Briefcase, Deborah Butterfield’s horse sculptures, and Roy Lichtenstein’s Three Brushstrokes. A Frank Stella abstract painted metal relief endures on the western wall.\nThe Whitney also operates a free special exhibition area to the west of the entrance at East 42nd Street, with exhibits refreshed six times a year and gallery talks on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The sign that once banned food and beverages in this exhibit space now bans smoking as well, a sign of the times even at the Philip Morris Building. Other public spaces that endeavor to provide a critical mass of art include the covered plaza at Two Lincoln Square and the covered pedestrian space at 590 Madison Avenue. An effort at tying a Whitney branch to another public space foundered years ago, at Two Federal Reserve Plaza downtown.\nEven without the art, the space satisfies many preferences of public space users. A food kiosk at the southwest corner provides refreshment. Next door are the public restrooms, not identified as such and requiring a security guard pass to enter. Two nearby pianos are available for ongoing programs. Numerous movable black tables and chairs cover the floor next to the kiosk and pianos, supplemented by comfortable built-in benches to the east that are continuously occupied. Closer to East 42nd Street and Park Avenue is a platform three steps up that is covered with movable tables and chairs nestled among several trees. Still more built-in benches here and at the northeast corner offer nooks and crannies for users.\nOne additional fact about the Philip Morris building is worth noting. When the City designated Grand Central Terminal a landmark in 1967, it also authorized the terminal owner to transfer otherwise unusable development rights to adjacent parcels. The Philip Morris building was the first building to take advantage of this option, purchasing 74,655 square feet of development rights from the terminal owners for use here. Recently, 383 Madison Avenue became the second building to utilize some of Grand Central Terminal’s development rights.\n"

The public space plaque is on the inside, recalling the adage about the tree falling in the forest when no one is around to hear it.\nThis may be all to the good, however, since the small plaza could hardly accommodate an onslaught of users with its two wooden benches and extremely high ledges. Regular users are happy in their relative isolation, secure behind ramparts, backs to the brick wall, supplied with water from the V-enclosed drinking fountain, cheered by the tiny flower patch east of the canopied lobby entrance. The remaining portion of residential plaza along the east side of Second Avenue is extra sidewalk in front of retail stores. The required bike rack was missing at last site visit. Three sculptures enlivened this part of the space.\n"

The Broadway arcade has a cluster of planters with trees at its south and north ends.\nInside the shopping arcade is an entrance to the building and escalators that carry pedestrians to an upper level. Like some of the escalators at neighboring 55 Broadway, however, the escalators here are a leftover amenity from provisions of the recently repealed Special Greenwich Street Development District. They connected the street and shopping arcade to a required “elevated shopping way,” located directly above the shopping arcade, that could link up north with an elevated shopping way at 55 Broadway and west to an “enclosed pedestrian bridge” spanning Trinity Place. Together, the shopping arcade and elevated shopping way were called a “shopping way.” When it become clear that the enclosed pedestrian bridge was never going to be built, then much of the rationale for the elevated shopping way at 55 Broadway evaporated, and the same thinking led the City to rescind the requirement for the elevated shopping way here. Instead, the owner is allowed to use the space for retail activities. At a recent site visit, the street-level shopping arcade had tables and chairs for an adjacent restaurant. No record of City approval for such use has been found.\nAlthough visually inviting, the elegant interior atrium space between the shopping arcade and arcade is not public space.\n"

            "details": "This building was the first to use provisions from the Special Theatre District, enacted in 1967 to encourage construction of legitimate Broadway theaters as well as a pedestrian circulation network. The developer agreed to provide a new Broadway theater and two through-block spaces connecting West 44th and 45th Streets west of Broadway in return for a floor area bonus. The more famous of the spaces, at least by name, is Shubert Alley, an uncovered corridor whose width extends from the back of One Astor Place toward the Shubert and Booth Theaters, both styled in Italian Renaissance architectural motif by Henry B. Herts in 1912-1913. At show time, the alley comes alive with audience members. Shubert Alley is one leg of a two-block pedestrian network completed by a covered, outdoor, through-block passageway one block north known appropriately enough as Shubert Alley Extension, at the back of the Marriott Marquis hotel. Closer to Broadway is the pedestrian thoroughfare, a covered, outdoor, through block arcade cutting through the base of One Astor Place that provides an entrance to the Minskoff Theater, a retail outlet, and much dark glass or otherwise blank walls.\n"

            "details": "This is one of four buildings developed by the Kaufman organization that provide public spaces recognizable for their whimsical artwork and voluntarily furnished functional amenities. For this building, Melvyn Kaufman described his goals as wanting “to make the building disappear. . . . The scale of any large office building is impossible for a human being to relate to. Our plaza is inviting, exciting, warm, and friendly. It makes people forget they’re at an office building.”\nHere, it is the arcade that makes the largest splash, featuring an aquatic theme that may be inspired by the Water Street address and aspiring to something different and grander than any other “as-of-right” arcade in the city. To begin with, it is more like a covered plaza than a narrow corridor, more designed for stationary rather than circulation usage. A moat filled with a shallow layer of water cleaves much of the space. Footbridges cross from the southeast side of Water Street between Old Slip and Gouverneur Lane and from the plaza abutting Gouverneur Lane. In past years, a sculpture, entitled Herring-like Fishes Swimming Upstream (1985), by a sculptor named Pamela Waters, presented tiny, angled, metal black-eyed “fishes,” presumably herring-like and swimming upstream, in the moat. The fish appear to have completed their journey and were not present at a recent site visit. An old candy store façade and soda pop machine add to the amusement.\nThe arcade space next to Old Slip features more art. In front is Rejected Skin (1969), by William Tarr. Two rectangular blocks of crushed metal, made from aluminum panels rejected for use in the construction of 77 Water Street as well as from the red body of an ambulance, lie atop each other on a white pedestal, above which hangs another metal cube suspended in air by a single thread. At back is George Adamy’s Month of June, five plexiglass disks in throat lozenge shades of pink, orange, and yellow, standing upright on horizontal white circular pads. Users seated here appear as travelers in H.G. Wells’ The Time Machine.\nThe rectangular plaza along Gouverneur Lane, called Bennett Park, is very usable, with plenty of seating, trees, and still more artwork. Helix (1969), by Rudolph de Harak, whose work appears at another Kaufman-developed public space, at 200 Water Street, took 120 one-inch-thick stainless steel strips and twisted them together in an upward spiral, presumably in a helix rotation. A water sculpture, Cityscape Fountains (1969), by Victor Scallo, showcases metal boxes and fountains in the only uncovered part of the moat.\nPlazas and arcades produced under the “as-of-right” provisions of the 1961 Zoning Resolution are not required to provide anything more than a surface plane, but Kaufman-constructed spaces typically rise above the “letter of the law.” Other Kaufman-developed “as-of-right” spaces and their higher aspirations are on view at the previously mentioned 200 Water Street and at 747 Third Avenue. Another Kaufman public space, an urban plaza at 767 Third Avenue, gamely satisfies the higher design standards governing urban plazas. The “letter of the law” approach for “as-of-right” plazas and arcades is visible throughout the city. From here, it is conveniently on display across Gouverneur Lane at 95 Wall Street.\n"

            "details": "Originally a barren plaza developed under the 1961 Zoning Resolution’s minimal “as-of-right” plaza standards, this space was voluntarily upgraded by its owner in the late 1980s as part of a general renovation to fix rainwater leaks, a common problem at plazas. The result is a substantial improvement. The red-brick-and-granite plaza fronting the northeast side of Maiden Lane and the northwest side of William Street features a large L-shaped landscaped swath that buffers interior seating from street and sidewalk. The thoughtful landscaping scheme has employed a variety of plant materials to ensure something of interest throughout the year. Over time, the tree palette has mixed Siberian dogwoods, andromedas, Japanese pagoda trees, pear trees, ginkos, crabapples, saucer magnolias, and hawthornes; the shrubs have included witch hazel, cornelian cherry, Japanese holly, and vibernum; and the myrtle ground cover has been interspersed with daffodils and narcissus.\nThe wood benches and antique-style lampposts bring to mind turn-of-the-century urban park appointments, while the urban-themed wall art keeps the space up-to-date. Granite ledges on the planter provide additional seating, while a smaller planter and two benches to the northwest offer an alternative experience. A standard arcade on Maiden Lane and a sliver of arcade on William Street offer protection from the weather.\nThe message from this transformation is readily apparent. Plazas created under the original 1961 Zoning Resolution’s bare-bones plaza rules can be voluntarily improved by their owners, to the benefit of the public as well as the private interest.\n"

            "details": "This aesthetically pleasing plaza illustrates perfectly one of the animating ideas underlying the City’s original 1961 Zoning Resolution: the Corbusian “tower in the park” typology adapted to a dense urban context. A modernist skyscraper rises sleekly from the plaza floor, its smoky black glass skin contrasting starkly with the clean plaza surface. The space encircles the four sides of this full-block lot, on Broadway and Liberty, Nassau, and Cedar Streets, securing light and air for itself, the streets, and lower stories of surrounding buildings. Equally important, however, is the statement of a building on its own terms, set apart from the bulkier street wall edges of many older downtown office buildings.\nThe portion of the space on the east side of Broadway between Cedar and Liberty Streets is a flat plane without seating or other functional amenities, a simple landscape well suited to the streams of workers hurrying to their next appointments. The recent placement of planters near Broadway, part of a plaza renovation by the new owners, will hopefully be short-lived. The flatness of space is successfully interrupted by an iconic welded steel-and-aluminum painted red cube sculpture by the Japanese artist Isamu Noguchi. The sculpture appears to be floating, suspended on edge, a miracle in defiance of gravity’s stern law. A hole carved out of the cube’s middle directs the observer, standing below the hole, to connect the plaza’s horizontality with the skyscraper’s verticality.\nThe building’s main entrance, on the south side of the lot abutting Cedar Street, is flanked by planters with trees, flowers, and ledges for seating. In the distance to the east is Jean Dubuffet’s Group of Four Trees (1972), a black-and-white sculpture growing out of the Chase Manhattan plaza, a pre-1961 space not required by law to be open to the public. Like the Seagram and Lever House spaces on Park Avenue in midtown, however, this space is a reminder that not every public space needs a zoning bonus to be constructed, and not every public space needs the halter of legal requirements to be of high quality. The short walk from 140 Broadway to the Chase Manhattan space is rewarded not only by a closer look at the Dubuffet, but by another Noguchi artwork, a below-ground water sculpture garden.\n"

Located at the southeast corner of Third Avenue and East 32nd Street, this clamshell-shaped space resolutely breaks away from standard angular geometries of corner plazas by curving almost everything it can. The 90-degree angle of the street intersection is softened by the sinuous sweep of several steps that navigate the grade change up to the plaza level, an open piazza unfolding to the south in front of the residential tower. Granite benches curl around five volcano-shaped brick planters in counter-rhythm to the swirling cut-stone paving pattern. More granite benches at the eastern side protrude in semicircles from planters filled with trees, shrubs, and flowers.\nAlthough a dedicated corridor leads from Third Avenue to the tower entrance, residents see and pass through the space as if it were their front yard. Given evidence of their use of the space along with members of the public, it clearly is.\n"

No record of City approval for such closure has been found.\nEight steps above the East 26th Street sidewalk and past an entry arch, the rectangular park extends roughly half a block north, enclosed on its three nonstreet sides by the building and a high wall to the west. Multiple levels of brick ledges one, two, and three feet in height protrude from the various sides, offering numerous opportunities for seating in sunny and shady conditions, the notable water feature is an important clue to the identity of the public space designer here, landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, who likes to enliven his urban spaces with large water structures. Water cascades downward from a hovering concrete frame astride several of the ledges, splashing, and even soaking, willing people seated or standing nearby. Wood benches, tall mature trees, and landscaping augment the parklike features and assure steady use during the summer by nearby residents, dogwalkers, and local teens.\nThe remainder of the public space is classified public open area and wraps around the building on East 26th Street, most of Second Avenue, and East 27th Street.\n"

The location and basic configuration recall the plaza at the back of 300 East 75th Street, except that here, buildings to the east, west, and south conspire to minimize the amount of sunlight reaching the ground. A concrete-framed metal fence stretches across the opening, with an entrance gate at the western side for access to the slightly elevated plaza floor. At a recent site visit, the space was not accessible, and no record of City approval for such denial of access has been found. The square displays a mixture of open space and low brick wall planters filled with trees and bushes. There is plenty of ledge seating and wooden benches attached to planter walls. Where an old sign previously prohibited ball playing, bicycling, littering, frisbees, and dogs, the new sign delivers its message of cultural updating by prohibiting chalk writing, radios, running, and skating (in-line, it is assumed). A landscaped open area is located at the front of the building, on East 89th Street between Park and Madison Avenues. It has landscaping, but little open area. The unusual names for these spaces come from a restrictive declaration filed by the owner and a City Planning Commission approval of such declaration.\n"

            "details": "Tensions between public and private uses reverberate throughout this elegant through block arcade connecting West 56th and 57th Streets between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. While some buildings disown their public space by segregating it, geographically and administratively, from the private entrances and activities, this private hotel by design and management has so masterfully integrated the though block arcade into its own functional orbit that it is difficult to tell where private ends and public begins. Like a tuning fork, the basic layout includes two legs from West 56th Street converging mid-block at a three-story atrium, and a single corridor stretching north from the atrium to West 57th Street. The blurring of private and public is especially pronounced in the western leg, entered from West 56th Street past a strip of plaza. Here, the through block arcade literally doubles as the hotel lobby, complete with check-in desk and support services. It would be impossible for any member of the public to discern that this is part of the public space without being told, as here, that it is. At least the doorway to the eastern leg off West 56th Street is identified on its glass window as an entrance to public space.\nInside here is a richly trimmed two-story corridor featuring polished patterned marble floor and walls of pastel pink and beige columns, arches, and mirrors. Seating that appears, disappears, and reappears in this corridor has led to a series of legal disputes between the City and building owner. The 1979 special permit requiring the through block arcade also mandated 54 movable chairs and 18 movable tables, allocated to this corridor and the mid-block atrium by plans approved as part of the special permit action. In 1991, following reported thefts from hotel guests that the owner attributed to perpetrators using the chairs, the owner applied to the City Planning Commission to reduce the amount and change the configuration of required seating. Although the application was never completed, the owner nonetheless removed the chairs.\nVisitors to the space who enjoyed the chairs, including dancers from the Joffrey Ballet who rehearsed nearby, were unhappy. On October 13, 1992, the City’s Department of Buildings issued a notice of violation for failure to maintain the movable chairs in this part of the through block arcade. An administrative law judge dismissed the notice on January 21, 1993, finding that the chairs were “not a point of emphasis” in the original 1979 special permit and that the chairs did not serve what he understood as the essential purpose of substantially improved pedestrian circulation. On appeal, the City’s Environmental Control Board reversed, concluding that the chairs did indeed provide “an important amenity” and that there was no proof that seating was an insignificant part of the conditions set forth in the special permit. The owner was fined $475 for its violation of the Zoning Resolution. The owner next brought its own action in a New York state trial court, claiming that the decision of the Environmental Control Board was arbitrary and capricious and requesting that the decision be annulled. On October 7, 1994, the state court judge dismissed the owner’s petition and upheld the Board’s determination.\nThe legal saga did not end there, however. Shortly after the judge’s decision, the Buildings Department filed another notice of violation for failure to provide required chairs and tables. This time, an administrative law judge on April 11, 1995 concluded that the apparently reduced number of movable chairs, benches, and a desk present at the time of the latest Building’s Department inspection were in substantial compliance with the original 1979 special permit.\nThe owner has recently stated that the chairs have been replaced with eight benches accommodating two-to-three people each, and twelve additional chairs, five tables, and a desk. Recent site visits have confirmed this arrangement, showing blond wood benches in the eastern corridor and additional large chairs and tables in the atrium. That adds up to at most 36 places to sit and five tables, short of the originally mandated 54 chairs and 18 tables. Additional discussions between the City and owner will be forthcoming.\nIn the middle of the arcade is the multistory skylit rectangular atrium surrounded by an upper-level loggia. The atrium appears to serve principally as a gathering space for hotel and restaurant guests and a crossing lane from the lobby to the private restrooms. The northern portion of through block arcade continues the postmodern design motif with decorative ceiling. Without seats and retail frontage, however, the corridor is quiet, serving strictly as a passageway to and from West 57th Street. Passersby on West 57th Street would have a hard time knowing that this is a public space. The multistory façade is a compressed mixture of columns, pilasters, and pediment presented in pastel shades of pink and beige that simply looks like a private entrance. Le Parker Meridien Hotel’s through block arcade is one of three choices, although not the most convenient one, for completing the six-block run of mid-block spaces from West 51st Street. For a further discussion of this profusion of choice, see the profile of the through block connection at Metropolitan Tower.\n"

            "details": "Although the slim depth of this plaza on part of the east side of Third Avenue and on East 46th and 47th Streets would normally leave little opportunity for creativity of design, the owner’s de facto annexation of the adjacent public sidewalk into the plaza’s aesthetic and functional orbit dramatically expands its overall impact. Immediately upon crossing East 46th or 47th Streets, the pedestrian necessarily engages the spatial experience. A sinuous red-tile and yellow-brick paving pattern covers the floor as well as vertical protuberances from building edge to street curb, interrupting and directing pedestrian flow north, south, east, and west. “Follow the yellow brick-edged road” is the best advice for navigating these sidewalks. For the public space specialist, the easiest on-site method for determining where plaza ends and public sidewalk begins is to eyeball the location of building edges north and south, across East 46th or 47th Streets.\nIn front of the Third Avenue entrance to the office tower is a wood-decked urban veranda, three steps above the plaza floor, under red canopies. Although movable veranda-style chairs would have been of a piece, the fixed wooden seats are clearly appreciated by users. Curving wood benches and stools span the plaza and public sidewalk at various points along the three street frontages, usually as part of sculpted armadillo-shaped brick berms and mounds. Some are covered with large blue canopies. Images of a horse pulling a fruit cart and a boy awaiting an ice cream truck are painted on the brick walls east of the loading docks and driveways on East 46th and 47th Streets. Miscellaneous amenities, including a bicycle rack on East 46th Street, a pay phone structure on East 47th Street, and antique-style lamps complete the space appointments.\nThe developer of 747 Third Avenue, the Kaufman organization, has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to developing public spaces that exceed the requirements specified by zoning. A Kaufman space is best known for its sense of humor, pop-art colors, fanciful amenities, bright lights, and/or artwork. In prior years, Melvyn Kaufman has sought acknowledgment from City officials of his efforts expended in excess of those required by the original 1961 Zoning Resolution for “as-of-right” plazas and arcades. This space, as well as spaces at 200 Water Street and 77 Water Street downtown, deserve special mention. The Kaufman organization itself consistently gives credit where credit is due. Plaques here cite the architects, designers, contractors, artists, and, most interestingly, the public, announcing, “This building was completed in 1972. We recognize that our right to build it was derived from you, the people. Around you is our expression of gratitude. We feel certain that you will join us in acknowledging those designers who had you in mind throughout.”\n"

            "details": "Wrapping around this office tower on the east blockfront of Third Avenue, East 48th Street, and East 49th Street, the U-shaped plaza and arcade serve twin goals of function and fun. The rushing pedestrian enjoys the extra sidewalk space afforded by the plaza and its uniform white-and-black paving pattern extending from building edge to sidewalk curb. When weather is inclement, the block-long arcade provides excellent shelter.\nPlayful touches start with Big Red Swing (1971), by Theodore Ceraldi, a red-steel swing seat in the shape of a piano lid attached to the arcade’s ceiling by three steel cables. Not only is the swing sittable, but, with a little effort, it is swingable. Under the arcade at the building entrance is a sculpture by the artist Beverly Pepper, entitled Contrappunto (1983), composed of steel bands that twist around contrapuntally. Usable amenities include benches on the southern half of the plaza on Third Avenue. North and south plaza fingers extending east on East 48th and 49th Streets are framed by long rectangular black planters with shrubs. A triangular patch of trees and shrubs grows out of the paving on Third Avenue near East 49th Street.\nThe building’s architect, William Lescaze, was well known for his International Style office buildings, in New York City, Philadelphia, and elsewhere. He and his wife lived around the corner, at 211 East 47th Street, a residence he designed in 1934 that was one of the first examples of an International Style townhouse in the city. Its glass block façade positively glows at night.\n"

The space serves both circulation and stationary activities, and it is possible to imagine a following among novice skateboarders and in-line skaters. Numerous white wire-mesh three-seater benches, comfortably sculpted to the human form, line each side, interspersed with modern, tall, silver, double-headed lampposts. Although sleek design is the order of the day, the question is whether it comports with legally approved plans detailing older-style park amenities of wooden and cast iron benches and cast iron posts with Central Park luminaires. Along Jay Street, the required movable chairs and tables were absent at a recent site visit. No record of City approval for the different or missing amenities has been located, and discussions with the owner are continuing.\nThe Adams Street side of the space receives plentiful sunlight and offers a good vantage point for appreciating the civic space in front of Brooklyn Borough Hall and its glistening golden statue holding the scales of justice. Along Jay Street in the adjacent building to the south is a food kiosk that furnishes refreshment to some of the bench users.

            "details": "Several steps east of Fifth Avenue and running parallel between East 52nd and 53rd Streets, the HarperCollins through block arcade distinguishes itself as much for what it connects as for what it is. Facing the arcade across East 53rd Street is Paley Park, one of the city’s treasured privately owned private spaces, open to the public through the goodwill of its owner. South across East 52nd Street is the entrance to Olympic Tower’s through-block covered pedestrian space. Together, the HarperCollins and Olympic Tower public spaces forge a two-block protected passageway making possible a direct pilgrimage between Saint Patrick’s Cathedral and Paley Park.\nAs for the through block arcade itself, it serves its purpose of pedestrian connection well. At East 53rd Street, a black cylindrical totem announces a beginning or terminus. Unenclosed at both ends, the two-story corridor is designed for movement, with capacious width, few retail distractions, and no obstructions. Like milestones, black rectangular columns on white stone walls rhythmically mark the journey’s progress. Long rows of theatrical lighting above gently guide users north or south and generate necessary illumination. Small plaza spaces occupy the building’s setbacks at both East 52nd and 53rd Street entrances and provide planters with evergreen bushes and, on East 52nd Street, a sittable ledge.\nBecause Paley Park is not a legally required privately owned public space, as that term is used in this book, it lacks its own profile. Its proximity to the HarperCollins space, however, provides a geographical hook, if not a convenient excuse, to remedy that exclusion. Designed by the noted landscape architectural firm of Zion & Breen and named for Samuel Paley by his son, the CBS executive William Paley who created the space, Paley Park opened on May 23, 1967, and has since become a model for how philanthropy and design can produce a peerless public space.\nThe 4,200-square-foot park (roughly 42 feet by 100 feet) eases its rectangular geometry through a sublime blend of natural and synthetic materials, textures, colors, and sounds. The park notifies passersby of its presence through strategic placement of trees, planters filled with brightly colored flowers, and special paving on the sidewalk. Up four steps through a narrowed entrance is ordered nature, a modernist landscape. As a stand-alone space unconnected to a bonused building and the stream of workers or residents in and out—a vest-pocket park without the suit– the space can focus on its singular mission of serenity, contemplation, and renewal.\nThe ground is paved not with terrazzo or concrete, but with rough-hewn stone tiles. The 17 trees, spaced at 12-foot intervals, grow out of the surface and are tall enough that their understory sustains an open air feeling while their canopies block out looming skyscrapers. Planters overflow with flowers. Ivy-covered brown-brick walls protectively envelop the space and exclude winds that bedevil so many plazas. Scattered generously throughout are movable Bertoia wire-mesh chairs (“Bird Chair,” by Harry Bertoia, 1950-1952) and movable tables. A food kiosk at the southeast corner gatehouse sells light refreshment, while the gatehouse at the southwest corner shelters mechanical equipment for park maintenance activities.\nAt back is the wondrous and accessible rock-faced 20-foot waterfall. If Paley Park’s visual cues have not removed the intensity of the city, then the whooshing water noise and spray will complete the job. Water does not trickle down, it pours down, hits a level, and then pours down some more into a pool. According to the park superintendent, a 50-horsepower pump pushes a recirculated 1,800 gallons per minute uphill for its downward journey. Only in January is the waterfall drained and turned off. Otherwise, on cold days, the water is heated by a steam turbine before it is pumped.\nPaley Park’s quality is confirmed by its unusual quantity and mix of users. In addition to the regulars who work or live nearby are the accidental or intentional tourists. On any given day, the roster might include random visitors from New Jersey or Japan as well as landscape architects and designers making the educational journey. At last check, the space maintained hours from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., May 1 through November 1, and from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., November 2 through April 30.\nIs there a lesson here? The subtext of the plaque near the entrance subtly implies one: “This park is set aside in memory of Samuel Paley, 1875-1963, for the enjoyment of the public.” No sign announces that the space is required by law to be open to the public. No zoning design standards were mandated and no zoning bonus was given. Like the outdoor spaces at Rockefeller Center, the 6,360-square-foot Greenacre Park on the north side of East 51st Street between Second and Third Avenues, or the Ford Foundation building atrium on the north side of East 42nd Street between First and Second Avenues, Paley Park is a product of a private owner’s sense of civic philanthropy, interest in urban design, and understanding of wise stewardship. Paley took high-value land that would normally accommodate a revenue-earning building and made way for a park. He hired a top landscape architect, Robert Zion, who had for years promoted the idea of “parklets” substantially smaller than the City Parks Department’s then prevailing notion that three acres was the minimum acceptable park size, to design the space. He and his wife created and funded the position of a full-time park superintendent and associated maintenance personnel. According to one of the recent superintendents, the two visited the space regularly, and Mrs. Paley’s morning stop included instructions about which flowers to plant each month. In short, zoning incentives and legal requirements are helpful, but not always sufficient, for the task of creating excellence in public spaces.\nPaley Park’s influence extends well beyond its borders. In New York City and elsewhere around the country, many urban outdoor spaces borrow design features from the park. Some New York spaces have substantially modeled themselves on Paley Park, including, for example, the nearby spaces at 520 Madison Avenue and 535 Madison Avenue, and the park at One East River Place.\n"

            "details": "This plaza is the northernmost of three titanic privately owned public spaces that occupy a three-block stretch along the west side of Sixth Avenue from West 47th to 50th Streets, in front of skyscrapers built for corporate headquarters. From south to north are the approximately 20,000-square-foot space at 1211 Sixth Avenue (formerly the Celanese building), the approximately 37,000 square feet of space at the McGraw-Hill building, and this almost 30,000-square-foot plaza at what once was known as the Standard Oil and Exxon buildings. Each public space was built in the early 1970s as part of the Rockefeller Center development complex; each was designed by the same architecture firm, Harrison and Abramovitz; each was conceived and executed in contemplation of the other two; and each boldly projected the view of New York City as a center of corporate power. Unexpectedly, their collective presence ignited a firestorm of criticism over the 1961 Zoning Resolution’s legal embrace of the “tower in the park” concept.\n\nThe problem was not inherent in the idea that a dense urban core like midtown Manhattan would need breathing spaces. Indeed, several blocks to the east, Mies van der Rohe’s 1958 Seagram Building, with its elegant plaza and duet of flanking fountains on Park Avenue between East 52nd and 53rd Streets, remains the city’s quintessential International Style masterpiece of “tower in the park” architecture as well as a strong element of urban design. But one must wonder how the Seagram space, and Park Avenue itself, would have fared had adjoining parcels mimicked the Seagram design. The very contrast of neighboring buildings and massings, from McKim, Mead & White’s masonry, low-rise Racquet and Tennis Club across the street to the angled floating tower of Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill’s Lever House to the less distinguished, but pleasantly differentiated, buildings to the north and south on the east side of Park Avenue, help secure Seagram’s legacy.\nTo many urban observers, the 1961 Zoning Resolution’s de facto reliance on the massing of the Seagram Building as a model for its high-density commercial district zoning envelope was mistaken. These observers argued that the “as-of-right” license granted to developers, to replicate without regard to neighborhood context the tower-plaza typology in return for a 10:1 zoning bonus, ruined this part of Sixth Avenue as well as other areas of the city. The plazas substituted vacant, wind-swept spaces for buildings built to the front lot line, destroying a sense of visual containment and allowing a grievous hemorrhaging of street energy otherwise fostered by retail frontage and constrained sidewalks. Although not every observer had such a negative view of the Sixth Avenue spaces — indeed, some admired their aesthetic presence, others their perimeter treatment along the sidewalk that engendered substantial sitting on ledges — the basic critique persevered and culminated in substantial plaza zoning reform in 1975 that would generally prohibit the plaza typology of the Sixth Avenue grouping.\nHere, a large, bright turquoise pool dominates the space. Water jets spray upward at the center and water spills down at back to a slender lower level. Ledge seating at front and back permits physical contact with the water. In good weather, the Sixth Avenue ledge is packed with people, backs to the water, eyes glued to the choreography of pedestrians and moving vehicles on the sidewalk and street. Although the size and presentation of the pool are impressive, they raise a question about how open and accessible to the public, or how usable, a public space is if it is largely covered by water, landscaping, or other elements that prevent physical access. According to the original 1961 Zoning Resolution’s definition of an “as-of-right” plaza, “ornamental fountains . . . shall be considered permitted obstructions.” One that covers this much of a space, however, pushes the concept. Indeed, without a narrow corridor between the back of the pool and the front of the building, a corridor that from time to time has been blocked by planters, pedestrians would have as much difficulty crossing this space as if the tower itself had been built to its front lot line. Other spaces that have installed huge amounts of landscaping with like effect raise similar questions about predominantly visual, as opposed to physically usable, “as-of-right” plazas. Physical usability here at least is supplied along the fountain edge at the sidewalk and at north and south ends of the plaza fronting Sixth Avenue, where elevated rectangular terraces furnish benches, trees, and planting. These terraces are similar to the ones one block south at the McGraw-Hill building flanking its sunken plaza. More plaza space extends westward along West 49th and 50th Streets in front of the building entrances.\nThe space at the back of 1251 Sixth Avenue is about to undergo an identity change of potentially long-term benefit to the public. The issue, at least in recent years, has not been the quality of the space, a verdant, park-like area known as Exxon Park between West 49th and 50th Streets. In what has been a surprising revelation to many public space experts, however, the park never was part of the building’s privately owned public space. A declaration of easements, covenants, and restrictions made by the owner in December, 1986, described it as a park, plaza, or pedestrian mall, but expressly reserved its use principally to persons connected with this building and not to the general public. Thus, although it has been heavily used by members of the general public for many years, it was never obligated to be open to the public by zoning rules. All this will change, however, when the proposed world headquarters for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, at 745 Seventh Avenue, is constructed on the lot to the west along West 50th Street. The developer of that site obtained a City special permit obligating it to reconstruct this space according to a new design approved by the City Planning Commission. During the construction phase of the building, the space will be closed to the public and will re-open when the building is ready for occupancy. The profile for 745 Seventh Avenue shows an image of that future space.\nUntil construction begins, and if the existing space is maintained for public use, then it is certainly worth a visit. The West 49th Street side is lined with tables and chairs used by a restaurant to the east and wooden planters and benches to the west. The West 50th Street side takes advantage of the extra area created by a recess in the back of the building and provides two zones of activity. In one, the focus is on food. Two kiosks face each other and offer refreshment for users seated at café tables and chairs arrayed on a raised wooden platform. The area to the east is for quieter activities. Mature trees and wooden benches furnish a rustic quality. A waterwall and pool tacked onto the back of the building mask noise and are easily approached down several steps. A sculpture by J. Seward Johnson, Jr., called Out to Lunch (1980), sets the right example: a seated man is eating a sandwich and reading a book about offshore saltwater fly fishing.\nA combination of public and private spaces at the backs of Sixth Avenue towers creates a four-block mid-block pedestrian network starting from the landscaped pedestrian plaza at Stevens Tower and ending here. It is also worth noting that the Sixth Avenue plaza to the north and in front of the Time-Life Building between West 50th and 51st Streets was built before the 1961 Zoning Resolution’s plaza provision and never received a bonus.\n"

As described by the owner’s lawyer before the City’s Board of Standards and Appeals, “Instead of utilizing the fingerlike projection on the south side of East 80th Street as a garage entrance-exit ramp, the lot area occupied by the fingerlike projection is developed as a plaza-type park.” The idea was interesting, but the execution flawed. At a recent site visit, the entrance to the plaza-like park from East 80th Street was fenced off, and the space behind the fence was full of garbage. No record of City approval for any changes to the plaza-like park requirement have been found. The remainder of plaza space is extra sidewalk in front of both Second Avenue and East 79th Street sides of the building.\n"

            "details": "Public spaces at PaineWebber reflect lessons learned from the indiscriminate provision of huge setback plazas on the west side of Sixth Avenue during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Under the original provisions of the 1961 Zoning Resolution, the PaineWebber building would have been able to construct “as-of-right” a 24,000-square-foot plaza on Sixth Avenue that would have generated almost a quarter-million square feet of bonus floor area, like the plazas in front of 1251 Sixth Avenue, McGraw-Hill, and 1211 Sixth Avenue to the south. What may have worked on an individual lot, however, became problematic when replicated in series. Nurtured by building street wall continuity, retail frontage, bounded public sidewalks, and density of pedestrian traffic, the avenue’s urban vitality was disturbed when the three plazas appeared next to one another. For some, this was the end of Sixth Avenue’s aspiration to great street status. Zoning amendments in 1975 and 1981 effectively prohibited such “as-of-right” plazas along Sixth Avenue by inaugurating new design standards, including requirements for amenities, and a City Planning Commission Chairperson’s review process known as “certification.” The day of massive plazas fronting office towers on Sixth Avenue was over, and a new dawn of urban plazas arrived.\n\nThe PaineWebber urban plaza is a fine example of the new approach. To begin with, the space is not even located in front of the building, which is barely set back from the west side of Sixth Avenue. Instead, the building’s south and north sides extending west from Sixth Avenue along West 51st and 52nd Streets are recessed to accommodate mirror-image rectangular plaza areas totaling slightly less than 10,000 square feet. Sculptor Scott Burton created two works for these areas, conveniently entitled Urban Plaza South and Urban Plaza North (1985-86). In the south plaza area, he installed three rows of fixed granite tables surrounded by three granite stools each that sprawl under the edge of the adjacent arcade. In form and layout, they suggest an archaeological find, as if some ancient religious order rather than public art virtuoso had dictated their design and placement. Two large triangular granite planters with bushes and built-in benches interpose a transitional zone between Sixth Avenue and the stone seats and tables. In the north plaza area, a reverse of the layout is attempted, with a series of angular polished granite benches closer to Sixth Avenue and triangular planters located at back.\nAn outdoor, partially skylit through block galleria connects West 51st and 52nd Streets mid-block between Sixth and Seventh Avenues at the back of the building. With its sculptures, wall murals of geometric patterns, water pool, and polished granite ledge seating and benches, the space serves destination, as well as circulation, ends, something expressly contemplated by the zoning standards for through block gallerias, in contrast to the solitary circulation focus of through block connections. The amusing bronze sculptures created by Barry Flanagan at each end are entitled Hare on Bell (1983) and Young Elephant (1984), and an elegant glass-and-gold-colored structure houses escalators that lead to the concourse level of the Rockefeller Center complex and the subway.\nAs the inaugural link in the City’s longest, most successful mid-block pedestrian network, a six-block chain linking West 51st to 57th Streets, the space makes its mark. People love secret passageways, those alternative ways to get from point A to point B often discovered by happenstance. From a design perspective, this type of mid-block passageway finds its conceptual origins in the elaborate shopping arcades of eighteenth and nineteenth century European cities. Covered shopping arcades appeared in Paris at the end of the eighteenth century as alternatives to the chaotic and, before Baron Haussmann’s mid-nineteenth century interventions, cramped Parisian streets. London introduced its own version of the shopping arcade in the nineteenth century, culminating in a number of graceful, soaring confections of glass, iron, and terra-cotta.\nAs a matter of zoning policy, the City’s ambition would be less extravagant. Simple mid-block shortcuts would be bonused or required, especially in the Special Midtown District’s designated corridor between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, as a means of easing the pedestrian’s burden along the lengthy avenue-to-avenue span and as a means of reducing sidewalk congestion. Knowing the difficulty of creating financially sustainable interior retail spaces, retail frontage would not necessarily be mandated, especially when no zoning bonus was granted. Fully indoor spaces would not necessarily be preferred when covered, outdoor corridors would perform adequately.\nThis space links West 51st Street to the through block galleria at Flatotel connecting West 52nd and 53rd Streets, the through block galleria at 1325 Avenue of the Americas between West 53rd and 54th Streets, the through block connection at Rihga Royal Hotel between West 54th and 55th Streets, the through block connection at CitySpire between West 55th and 56th Streets, and, principally but not exclusively, the through block connection at Metropolitan Tower. As discussed in the profile of the through block connection at Metropolitan Tower, there are two other choices for reaching West 57th Street from West 56th Street without setting foot on or straying outside the boundaries of Sixth or Seventh Avenues, including the through block arcade at Le Parker Meridian Hotel and the through block connection at Carnegie Hall Tower.\nThere are five other mid-block pedestrian networks fabricated from privately owned public spaces in the city. A four-block chain connects West 44th Street to 48th Streets and is described in the profile for Millennium Broadway. The others are each two blocks long, connecting East 48th to 50th Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenue as described in the profile of Tower 49, connecting East 51st and 53rd Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenues as described in the profile of Olympic Tower, connecting East 55th to 57th Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenues as described in the profile of Sony, and connecting West 44th to 46th between Broadway and Eighth Avenues as described in the profile of One Astor Place.\nThe City has also encouraged the creation of subterranean- and above-street-level pedestrian networks. For example, a number of office buildings, for example, Paramount Plaza, have received floor area bonuses to provide street-level access and below-ground concourses linking to the subway system. Downtown efforts, such as the recently repealed Special Greenwich Street Development District south of the World Trade Center and its second-level pedestrian bridges, have met with mixed results, as described in the profile of One Bankers Trust Plaza.\nThe through block galleria here marks the physical dividing line between the PaineWebber building and the Equitable Center. Designed by different architects — Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed PaineWebber, Edward Larrabee Barnes designed Equitable — and developed separately in two phases, the buildings together offer an incredible array of art in their indoor privately owned lobbies that are nonetheless voluntarily opened to public visitation. In the monumental lobby of the Equitable Center, for example, is Thomas Hart Benton’s America Today (1930), a ten-panel Works Progress Administration tempera on linen that depicts American life and social conditions of the 1920s. A huge Roy Lichtenstein work, entitled Mural with Blue Brushstroke (1984-85), was commissioned for this space. The PaineWebber Gallery has its own rotating collection of compelling artworks. The sidewalk widening (pedestrian circulation space) along much of West 51st and 52nd Streets extending to Seventh Avenue completes the public space here.\n"

            "details": "Visually and functionally, the primary portion of this urban plaza is the wide, outdoor through-block corridor connecting West 52nd and 53rd Streets, east of Sixth Avenue between the CBS building to the west and the Deutsche Bank building to the east. Changes to the “as-of-right” plaza zoning regulations in 1975 and 1982 introduced enhanced amenity and design requirements for plazas at office buildings in midtown, including a general prohibition against north-facing spaces. The need for such a prohibition had become obvious. Plazas obtained under the “as-of-right” 1961 plaza rules could face north, and such an orientation too often created dark, cold, relatively inhospitable places.\nAlthough it appears that this urban plaza has southern frontage on West 52nd Street, this is not the case. In fact, a large piece at the southwest corner of the space actually is part of the CBS building zoning lot. Thus, in the eyes of zoning, the Deutsche Bank urban plaza came to a dead end substantially north of West 52nd Street frontage, and thus would have been legally prohibited. Because it is impossible for planners and lawyers to anticipate every development permutation, zoning amendments become necessary correctives. It is not uncommon for new and unexpected fact patterns to trigger reexamination of existing zoning rules. Here, because the plaza could de facto, if not de jure, secure south-facing frontage if it could make an arrangement with CBS to use some of its zoning lot, it would make little sense to prohibit it. Thus, the City Planning Commission in 1983 approved a zoning amendment allowing a north-facing urban plaza, such as the one here, if “such plaza is contiguous to an open area fronting on a south facing street line on an adjoining zoning lot to form a ‘through block plaza.’” The owner of the Deutsche Bank building zoning lot entered into an agreement with the owner of the CBS building zoning lot that permitted the Deutsche Bank building owner to add 4,167.22 square feet of CBS lot to its urban plaza, thereby forming the through-block plaza required by the zoning. Form and substance became one.\nThe urban plaza is formal, even austere, in its appearance. Where the surfaces of public spaces are sometimes all brick or all concrete, the surfaces here are all granite, interrupted briefly by dashes of colorful flowers. Seven imposing red-granite piers rise four stories along the building lobby to the east, deemed by one critic as “Aztec/Egyptian temple” post-modern. At the western edge across the granite floor is a block-long serpentine seating ledge with a back that serves as planter wall for a row of trees and colorful flowers. At north and south ends of the corridor are small planters with built-in benches, trees, and flowers. Halfway between West 52nd and 53rd Streets is a 22-foot-high sculpture entitled Lapstrake (1987), by sculptor Jesus Bautista Morales, composed of horizontal polished granite slabs alternating with slabs and pieces of rough-hewn granite.\nThe connection between the CBS building, popularly known as Black Rock, and the Deutsche Bank building, is not solely a matter of zoning. Access between this urban plaza and the CBS plaza is provided down several steps. Furthermore, the CBS building was designed by Eero Saarinen, the Finnish-American architect known, among other things, for his flowing airline terminals at Kennedy and Dulles Airports, in collaboration with architects Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo. The Roche-Dinkeloo firm also designed the Deutsche Bank building, first known as the EFHutton building. Additional urban plaza may be found in the form of more sidewalk on West 52nd and 53rd Street sides of the building.\n"

The space resembles the plain “as-of-right” plaza as defined by the 1961 Zoning Resolution, but no record of City approval has been located to support this regression.\nThe under-maintained rough concrete surface is interrupted by two large temporary plywood boxes at north and south sides of the area along First Avenue that serve no public space purpose. Various discordant awnings overhang the retail frontage. The usable residual space along East 75th Street has planters with high brick ledges sittable for a tall person.

The design of the space creates increasingly less public environments as the user moves from street to building. At front, up several steps, is the public zone, an open terrace bordered by planters stocked with trees and shrubs. Planter walls are angled to create niches for the built-in wooden benches. Deeper in and up more steps is a smaller, less public zone enveloped by overhanging trees and plantings. Additional bench and ledge seating is available. Completing the transition from public to private realms is a strip of “visual residual” residential plaza that, under the Zoning Resolution, is a “landscaped visual amenity” not required to be physically accessible to the public.\nAs beneficial, even unusual, as this parklike space may be, its location behind the building and interposition of a visual residual greenbelt make it feel remote, even forgotten, a perception exacerbated by the overgrown vegetation. Residents may walk past the space if they use the back entrance, and even enter it through two gates, but the design of the ramped corridor all but guarantees physical separation. It is interesting to ponder whether, or how, this space would be different were it situated near the front of the building on East 46th Street, where more visual residual residential plaza space flanks the main entrance.\n"

            "details": "The City obtained open space and sidewalk widenings along with the developer’s agreement to provide a major subway station improvement, in exchange for a zoning floor area bonus. An above-ground, triangular glass structure surrounded by comfortable green-and-black polished granite bench hovers over the subway entrance at the southeast corner of Lexington Avenue and East 53rd Street. The public space wraps fully around the building along the avenue as well as East 52nd and 53rd Streets and includes three recessed areas inside the building’s curtain wall. Although not a public space, the private lobby nonetheless engages the passing pedestrian. Visible through the glass-walled, two-story arcade is a colorful Frank Stella artwork, entitled Salto Nel Mio Sacco (1985), adorning the lobby wall. Such transparency into normally invisible lobbies and the intent to display art for passersby as well as building tenants can, as here, greatly enhance the experience of the exterior public spaces. It is instructive to compare this public space with another one fronting a private lobby exhibiting Stella artwork, at 375 Hudson Street in lower Manhattan. Permitted café tables and chairs installed by the adjacent storefront food service on East 52nd Street offer members of the public places to sit without obligation to purchase.\n"

            "details": "The best portion of this residential plaza is located roughly 200 feet west of Second Avenue on the south side of East 40th Street. Unlike some residential plazas that expose themselves either too much or too little to adjacent streets and sidewalk, this space shrewdly adopts an intermediate position. Half its frontage is open to the sidewalk, half is lined by a three-foot-high planter. The effect is noticeable from outside and inside. Passersby feel that they are graciously admitted, and indeed can see over the planter into the space. Users within the space savor some sense of separation from the movement and noise of the external world, yet enjoy a spectacular view of the Chrysler building’s shining spire to the northwest.\nAnother effective choice is the absence of a separate residential entry corridor. Here, because the building’s entrance opens directly onto the northeast corner of the space, the space itself serves as shared entryway for private residents and public users alike. By declining to segregate the two, the design promotes a spirit of stewardship that often results in superior upkeep and social interaction.\nInside, a combination of enclosure and openness prevails. The building to the east, a 30-foot-high brick wall attached to an adjacent building to the west, and four majestic old trees rising from a neighboring lot to the south, define the edges of this open, red-brick courtyard. Indeed, it is a happy fortuity that the four trees, growing on a lot apparently not belonging to this lot, nonetheless serve the space well. The featured amenity is a 15-foot waterfall serenely descending down gray-brown granite tiles that leaven the ubiquitous red brick. Sittable ledges ring the water pool and are heavily occupied during warmer days. Interior sides of planters offer additional seating possibilities. Hidden in back behind the water pool is a small, shaded nook whose loose gravel surface and landscaping furnish a secret garden. It is easy to imagine a summer movie series utilizing the tall brick wall to the west as movie screen, the courtyard filled with a neighborhood audience.\n"

            "details": "As of this writing, the privately owned public spaces at 622 Third Avenue, formerly the Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield headquarters, are undergoing a resizing, reconfiguration, and renovation under the terms of a zoning modification granted by the City Planning Commission in October, 1998. The newly approved plan is meant to produce superior clarity, functionality, and amenity to what has been a challenging and challenged effort of multilevel outdoor public space design.\nAlthough the building has a one-story frontage and an address on Third Avenue, the bulk of its square footage is concentrated in the mid-block through-block tower located between Third and Lexington Avenues, with entrances on both East 40th and 41st Streets. From here, the public spaces radiate outward and upward in a highly complex, three-dimensional galaxy. The proposed alterations will not change most of these basic spatial alignments. “As-of-right” plaza will continue to be located west of the East 41st Street building frontage, with new planters and bike rack, and “as-of-right” arcade spaces will still grace the East 41st and 40th Street building entrances. Previously, two through block arcades formed a T-junction mid-block at the eastern edge of the tower, one running north-south between East 40th and 41st Streets, the other connecting Third Avenue to the midpoint of the north-south through block arcade. Now, the north-south through block arcade will be enclosed at both ends, while the east-west through block arcade will have its roof removed and be legally reclassified as plaza space.\nAn urban plaza will replace and functionally upgrade what had been an obscure, terraced “as-of-right” plaza running through-block between East 40th and 41st Streets adjacent to the north-south through block arcade. The linear space will be reconstructed to be completely at grade, with three areas of landscaped planters down the middle, plentiful ledge seating, and tables and chairs. Most significantly, the Escher-like erection of outdoor escalators and stairs next to East 40th Street that provided entry to the landscaped terrace one level up will be removed. Although theoretically useful for easy access, the escalators were often out-of-order and the overall structure made the mid-block part of the plaza feel trapped and disconnected. By opening up the southern end, more light and air and a greater sense of openness and freedom should prevail.\nThe escalators have been traded in for an elevator at the northwest corner of the landscaped terrace to ferry individuals mechanically to and from the space, while stairs will continue to provide access from Third Avenue north of the corner at East 40th Street. Hopefully this combination will adequately handle user traffic to the newest incarnation of the landscaped terrace occupying the rooftop of the tower’s one-story extension at the corner of Third Avenue and East 40th Street. That space has always had promise, with its southern exposure and remove from the street, but the original design and amenities never matched the promise. Mushroom-domed tables, molded plastic seats, and planters with trimmed hedges proved perfunctory at best, depressing at worst. The new design upgrades everything, including the seating, tables, landscaping, trees, and surface materials, and requires a food service kiosk which must be operated in good faith at reasonable times. If all works as planned, this landscaped terrace should prove a substantial lunchtime competitor to the elevated public space at Murray Hill Mews three blocks south on East 37th Street west of Third Avenue.\n"

A six-foot retaining wall along the public sidewalk signals the existence of the small elevated area, up a narrow ramp and past a gate. The initial view is of dumpsters, arrayed near the building’s service entrance behind a planter, and representing the only association between the building and the space. Near the East 40th Street perimeter is a planter with tree and sculptural stone objects arising out of a gravel-and-stone floor. A bicycle rack is the only other notable attribute here. The remaining plaza area wraps around the building at the northwest corner of East 40th Street and Second Avenue. A row of birch trees grows out of a long planter with spiked interior ledge on East 40th Street. The avenue side features a small semicircular drop-off driveway, the arcade at the front door, and several additional planters with spikes.\nBecause this plaza is directly across East 40th Street from the Highpoint’s residential plaza, and the Vanderbilt’s residential plaza is immediately west of the space, comparisons are all but unavoidable. This space and the Highpoint, for example, are roughly the same size, but they differ dramatically in appeal, functionality, and integration with their host building. The explanation is not hard to uncover. Completed in 1973, the Marlborough produced its space under the lenient “as-of-right” plaza standards set forth in the original 1961 Zoning Resolution, while the Highpoint completed its space 15 years later under the residential plaza zoning standards enacted in 1977. Such history and propinquity all but guarantee that this space will not be used in its present condition.\n"

The atrium rises to a glass skylight four stories above. A first-floor bank office is cloaked with black opaque windows originally intended to be transparent. The upper floor windows are transparent, with interior offices visible. The floor and lower wall are clad in “Jet Mist,” a white-swirled black granite quarried in Culpeper, Virginia, cut and honed in Georgia.\nMonopolizing the center of the space is one of the largest indoor ficus trees in the city, almost two stories in height. Lit by several batteries of portable and recessed lights, the tree looks surreal, as if an object of ceremonial worship. According to the concierge, the tree, or at least its predecessor, was bred under a rattan, out of direct sunlight, to equip it for a life spent indoors. A substantial attraction on the east wall is the Jean Dubuffet artwork, completed at his studio outside Paris in 1971 and bought specifically for the atrium. Designed to hang next to one another, as parts of a deconstructed triptych, are Le Deployment Paralogique (Paralogical (or Illogical) Unfolding), Le Taciturnienne (Taciturn One), and Poule Volante (Flying Hen). Dubuffet’s highly recognizable imagery, painted in reds, blues, and black stripes on white fiberglass and canvas on fiberglass, cleverly tweaks the minimalist ambiance. Perhaps because seating is confined to a rectangular granite bench hugging the south wall and the tree’s planter ledge, the atrium is rarely crowded. Given the cluster of large indoor spaces, some with high decibel levels, in the general vicinity, the space’s quiet demeanor is worth preserving if only for neighborhood public space diversity.\nThe atrium may be reached via a through block arcade equivalent entered from the east side of Park Avenue south of East 59th Street, or by the sidewalk widening equivalent and open urban plaza equivalent from the south side of East 59th east of Park. How did these spaces obtain such ponderous names? The Board of Standards and Appeals granted a variance permitting the developer to construct extra floor area and requiring the provision of these spaces. Since they were legally required as part of a BSA variance action rather than a City Planning Commission special permit or certification action, they did not have to meet zoning’s definition of a through block arcade, an urban plaza, or a sidewalk widening. On the BSA-approved plans, they are thus labeled “equivalents” by the owner and architect.\n"
